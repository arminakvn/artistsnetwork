Yalter  has lived in Paris since 1965. She participated in the French counter culture and revolutionary political movement of the late 1960s, immersing herself in the debate around gender, migrant workers from Turkey, and other issues of the time.  She also experimented in different media including drawing, photography, video, and performance art.  She was a member of Fighting Women, a group of women artists who were active from 1976 to 1980.  Her earliest feminist work, A Nomad’s Tent, a Study of Private, Public, and Feminine Spaces dates from 1973. The Headless Woman or the Belly Dance, 1974,is a classic of early feminist art.   In 1978, she mounted a performance and installation acting out everyday life in a harem using a few pieces of furniture and utensils as part of  A Day of Actions, held in the studio of one of the other members of the collectif. The video of that day was recently found in 2011 when art historian, Fabienne Dumont, was working on a book about Nil Yalter. It was digitized by the French National Library and is one of the few videos of the French feminist art movement in the 1970s.

This last work employs shaman masks from Paris’s ethnographic Musée de l’Homme, and reflects her resistance to the appropriation by museums in the West. She has had many solo exhibitions including several at theMuseum of Modern Art of Paris, starting in 1973 and coming up to the present time.  Her work was included in the influential WACK! exhibition in the United States which traveled from the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art to the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, DC, the Museum of Modern Art PS1 galleries, and the Contemporary Art Center, Vancouver, Canada.

She learnt to draw and paint under the tutelage of Omar Onsi and Moustafa Farroukh, prominent Lebanese artists who adopted impressionist and realist styles. A trip to Egypt in 1943 sparked her passion for Islamic art and architecture and her conviction – despite the beliefs of her tutors – that Arab artists ‘reached into the essence of the subject, stripping it of all the associated with art since the time of the Greeks until the end of the 19th century.’/nAt the end of the 1940s Choucair spent three important years in Paris where she absorbed the current themes, trends and philosophies of European modernism. Though she was a student at the École des Beaux-Arts and attended the studio of the master Fernand Léger, Choucair found like-minded individuals at the Atelier d’Art Abstrait, a group of artists committed to the pursuit of abstract or non-objective art. The exhibition at Tate Modern begins with a group of vibrant gouache paintings from this period, showing the artist’s experiments with repeated, modular forms inspired by her love of geometry and mathematics.","Saloua Raouda Choucair Infinite Structure 1963-5/nSaloua Raouda Choucair"

His paintings are a manifesto for freedom, colour, light and joy, as well as being a permanent bridge between the art scenes of France and Lebanon and that of Europe and the Middle East. Both Lebanese and Parisian, he was very attached to Lebanon, to its landscapes, its light and his own childhood memories. He was from a Lebanese Arab Modern culture. The stories of his grandmother, who was the village’s story-teller, left an indelible mark on him, at a very early age. He was familiar with the paintings of the travelling story-tellers. The artist’s eye was also strongly influenced by Byzantine icons and traditions from his church.

At the core of this is her fascination with the networks and structures of connection that inhabit public spaces and become the framework for peoples’ interactions with each other as well as how these networks become visible through – amongst other things – cultural customs, architectural models and city planning. Structures and networks are not just concepts that Hefuna explores as subject matter but are also deployed in a more literal sense as mechanisms within her creative process. Within her recent drawings, inspired by these networks, Hefuna creates grids of connected dots with ink and pencil on multiple layers of tracing paper. These lattices are not created through strict predetermined systems but, rather, are intuitively composed and open to change and subversion. The outcomes evoke embroidery and tapestry, but also molecular structures, maps, cityscapes, or, as with much of her work, the intricacies of the traditional wooden mashrabiya screens of Cairo."

In my work, I pay a great deal of attention to the structures of forms, shapes, and colours, which create the inhabitable space that begins to resemble stories and life experiences behind the composition. The idea is to allow viewers to detach themselves from notions of normality, and question their reason for existence. These shapes symbolise the idea of isolation conferred by this perspective.My pieces are composed of various layers that convey the concept of the painting.

Though throughout his career Saad has been influenced by myriad artists, he attests that he doesn't 'follow' anyone; and, likewise, Saad is not an artist who wants to be 'followed', either. As Saad himself notes, 'I raise the white flag and surrender to what's within me, so it can emerge naturally without obstructing its due course. That is me. No one is to judge - they should only embrace or reject'."

"Walid Raad","http://www.eoaprojects.com/artists/walid-raad/profile","Born in 1967 in Chbanieh in the Lebanon, Walid Raad is an artist whose work reflects the troubled history of his country of origin, which he has witnessed since childhood. By collecting, modifying and creating photographs, texts and videos, he plays on the idea of the document as it relates to the civil war and the troubles between communities which have shaken this territory. The artist infuses his depictions with a cloudiness intended to throw doubt on the notion of documentation itself, and posing a profound question about how History is constructed. His working method involves artistic processes such as montage, hijacking and displacement which he uses to create his poetic, semantic distortions against the backgrounds he manipulates. Since 1999, this work on archives and memory through images has evolved around the Atlas Group, a fictitious organisation which produces, conserves and studies documents about the contemporary history of Lebanon, initiated and activated by Walid Raad. The artist is also a member of the AIF (Arab Image Foundation), an institution based in Beirut since 1997, responsible for collecting and promoting a visual heritage of the Middle East, North Africa and the Arab Diaspora. Walid Raad lives and works in Beirut (Lebanon) and New York (USA). He teaches at the New York Cooper Union art school. An artist of great international renown, he has exhibited in Europe, in the Middle East and in North America, notably in a major retrospective in 2006 at the Hamburger Banhof (Berlin, Germany) then in 2010 at the Whitechapel Gallery (London, United Kingdom), as well as at the 104 within the Festival d’Automne in Paris (France).

Ali Al-Tokhais is a professor of sculpture and shows with pride pictures of his students with their work.Al-Tokhais has said that the Arabic alphabet is a silent influence in his work that by itself is abstract. But the abstraction is taken away again by contemplation while the rock is revealing its new form or perhaps as an afterthought.

She landed her work Jeem in the British Museum at a sideshow to the 2012 Hajj exhibition and on her blog in December 2011 she was kind enough to allow the world a sneak preview of 'the making of Jeem' showing us how she wrestled with stencils to separate light and darkness on an octangular piece of wood, creating and image which looks like at least two works of art, intimately attached to each other for a fate of eternal friction. She mentioned online her interest in Islamic art and Jeem reflects exactly that, but even more so the work left us with the impression that the very best things might well happen outside the greater plan of known geometry. The people she most admires in the field of art? Leonardo da Vinci and Banksy. Felemban finished highschool in 2011 and describes herself now, for those who twitter, as an 'amateur artist.' An opinion with which we are inclined to strongly disagree, if not Da Vinci would have said exactly the same about himself. In her frequent writing on blogs she takes an interest in what other artists do and make. Her frank contribution 'Let the walls speak' for pan-arabic Mashallah News reported on the growth of street art in her country and made an interesting read. (2012)                                                         ***After writing the above, the artist informed us of the concept of Jeem, which is the first letter of both 'janna' (heaven) and 'jaheem' (hell). The artist based the design on each of the two squares in this octangular work on one of these words using the geometric kufi typeface creating a 'complex contrast' as they overlap. We would say she delivered her concept exactly right and trusted chance to help her deliver. (2012)"

And in this you can't help noticing how often he uses light blue, actually seems to adore the colour or to find it necessary. Al-Khalif is a true colorist not just painting the world but laying a reef of paintings over Jeddah as if he regrets that coral and fishes were left to the sea and below its surface and birds to the sky. As a master of art education and head of such education in north Jeddah his proficiency in handling oils and perhaps acrylic paint should be judged self evident, but surprising is how many paintings he shows in his presentation on facebook. They number hundreds and with consistency of vision and of life, sometimes changing the subject to calligraphy or horses. Occasionally Al-Khalif explores a naïve realism or his usual abstract style with more subdued colours. Some of his works appear to be wallpaintings by themselves or to have been assembled with square canvasses brought together to match. All these are styles and themes not unusual in the country, but Al-Khalif easily convinces as being master of any caravan.Al-Khalif mentiones many exhibitions in Jeddah and many in countries in Europe representing his country. Out of hundreds of his paintings I selected a few special images, which perhaps don't give an idea of his most frequent themes and style, but which celebrate the diversity and richness of Jeddah life as a result of its position as port to Makkah.

On her facebook page the artist made it known that she made the painting using a model for the guard and that moving outside with the model, having him stand in the sun, added to her grasp of reality, when his eyes and face reacted to the sun.

"Huda Totonji","http://www.greenboxmuseum.com/sa-hudatotonja.html","Huda Totonji might exist in an imagined space somewhere in between Washington and Jeddah. This is a space where masculine poetry is mastered by learning and examination and from where travel is possible in both directions. In Jeddah the artist may land herself as a philosophical doctor of visual technology and in Washington she may arrive as a true master of calligraphy. She has earned both these qualifications. The artist-researcher and teacher will not have herself pinned down in a single category. She 'chooses to bounce between image and text,' is what she writes on her website, and to this should be added that she believes good restaurants should manage to serve a large menu. Her art ranges from painting in several genres, such as portrait, landscape, still life and calligraphy, to mixed media installations and performances. In none of it however she will represent women 'physically' as was often done in the history of western figurative art. Her George Mason University master thesis installation Birdwatcher (2004) seemed to mock such orientalist paintings as Ingres's Grande Odalisque or anything of the like by Matisse and other artists who are central to the western canon of art. In fact Orientalism itself might qualify as 'birdwatching' if you come to think of it. Huda Totonja would have disappointed the oriental minded gentlemen in their London and Parisian chambers and clubs. Her giant birdcage was empty and only feathers and hairpins were left for such eager-to-collect and very civilised men. So was it about Iraq and Afghanistan? The artist probably never intended it to be like that. But, whoever thought that there would be a giant bird of wings, bones and flesh to be caught in that war, might have better reviewed Totonja's empty cage first. This is what she says: that the female vision is central to what she makes."

"Mahdi Al Jeraibi","http://www.greenboxmuseum.com/sa-mahdialjeraibi.html","Mahdi Al Jeraibi (1969) works as an art teacher in Mecca where children write and scratch, but hardly draw on their school desks. Really, I wondered: who or what for 25 years made these children not mix rabbits and automobiles with their doodle writing and daydream scratching? It is what we should do: wonder and ask. It is the artist who wants us to. About the school desks which he collected and presented as readymades for the audience to place on a wall. 'ALL WERE HERE,' it read about the desks and note that the exhibition was in Jeddah and not in Mecca. The artist wants dialogue about our memories. He presumes we can do so in a Socratic manner, disagreeing and convincing each other, using points of reference which work for us all. He wants us to explain and argue about traces of our past, which he simply picks up from the floor or out of the school's backyard. In a way he wants us to go back in time as if we were to cut off our hair; and then he will collect it and remind us that we will grow it back again, unable to change its colour or substance. It changes only slowly with the passing of generations. So is there no point in painting it for any future? Actually there is. Dark haired people who paint their hair blond, lure their partner's blond hair genes into changing direction. So I read somewhere in a scientific paper. In the end the dialectic argument aims to convince. But on the rational level, in the educated world, in the world of Mahdi Al-Jeraibi, in the world of Saudi Arabia's first conceptual artist, we should be optimistic about the potential of art to achieve faster results. Convincing in Al Jeraibi's Mecca is possible on, well, a moments notice, simply by listening and allowing yourself to be convinced. Of his art perhaps. Of his sombre Zincographs which are as far removed from golden palms in Dubai hotels as one can possibly imagine. They are of the moon, rather than of the sun - there is no real zinc involved -  shining a dark light on the crossing over of religious rituals of pilgrims, superstitions which survive in Mecca and a fear we have of a know known future of using DNA to recreate. The Zincographs are sculptered paintings: large wooden frames in which the artist has fixated hair he has collected of a variaty of people in a thick plate of hot wax. They are reminicent of ancient Egyptian wax portraits to a conceptual mind only. The hair he used he collected both from anonymous pilgrims - beware of Mecca barbers selling clones - and from individuals he knows well and managed to convince. As one of them is said to be his wife, there is a question that arises in the mirror of memories. Will Al Jeraibi, when his wife's hair is eventually used to clone, be the first Pygmalion to have succeed in giving true life himself to a women of his perfect imagination? We should grant her that. The artist himself is the object of imagination too. The Foundation Al Mansouria who has supported him against the dragons of misunderstanding and disinterest has put him forward as a 'model for the quest of the young and serious.' We should grant them that too. (September 30, 2009)."

She is surely, however, the only such artist who can and will say: I am a citizen of Saudi Arabia, not speaking on her own behalf, but informing the world of her private experiences in the general context of being a professionally working woman in Saudi Arabia. She does so with several series of black and white photographs of women she meets dealing with their Saudi heritage and daily life. I am a Mother and I am a Petroleum Engineer are self evident titles in her I am series. Dowayan, being a freelance photographer with an education in information technology, works for an oil company. She is now its creative director. In her series Beyond the veil and The Choice again women pose in front of Dowayan's camera. The choices Dowayan deals with are not mentioned but shown and numbered. The Choice V shows, for example, a woman in traditional dress holding a tennis racket. Or in Choice II, perhaps the most daring in terms of the question it seems to ask, a female hand holds a pen which has just crossed out a word on a page full of repetition. Her photographs are very popular with collectors, is what I was told by Edge of Arabia, in which exhibition she participated in both London (2008) and Venice (2009). A The Choice photo of a Saudi woman holding a steering wheel was printed in Dutch magazine Kunstbeeld as an iconic image of the exhibition, providing well for the notions people have in the Netherlands about Saudi Arabia. But, one should also have a look at her close up of feet dancing in Spanish Scenes and admire simply the elegant black and white forms beyond any context of meaning; fingers that fly like swans and do not point to any future. On the future of art in Saudi Arabia however, Dowayan has sound ideas which she expressed in Arab News. She told the paper that there should be more patronage of the arts in the Kingdom itself and not just by a government system of prizes. The country needs homegrown private foundations to sustain the arts and crafts. Says Manal Dowayan, who listens well to King Abdullah. The custodian of mosques said of Saudi women: that they are citizens of Saudi Arabia. And some of them even travel to Amsterdam. (2009)."

The galleries on his website show a variety of approaches to the art of catching our eye, that the artist used over changing periods of time. In the first gallery are images of his early works which were made before 1999 when he was endeavouring to paint reality. Then his second gallery (1999-2001) is more interesting. While some Saudi artists seem to make this conscious decision to paint in an abstract style, it is evident from his work that Haider went to the Jeddah coastline and bathed his eyes in the chaotic behavior of waves that meet the shore. From this his painting may have turned to abstraction by a longing to join the swim. Great painters like William Turner would have given a nod of approval. But this avenue Haider did not pursue for long. In 2002 he turned into the desert with a style of slight abstraction with references to Saudi traditions and religion. What abstraction is there in an Arab horseguard, but for speed and what more abstraction is needed than the truth in an image of Kaaba? After 2005 Haider leaves this style again and comes up with a range of experiments. But he keeps with him his deconstruction of a traditional ornament.

"Ola Hejazi","http://www.greenboxmuseum.com/sa-olahejazi.html","Ola Hejazi last listed education is that of soft ground etching at the Slade art school at University College of London in 2002, but credit should be given to the Saudi Art Centre in Jeddah where she first touched the oils in 1995. Hejazi, as is in the name, is a Saudi national, although born in Lebanon. She has a very adequate website and will share her appreciation of modern art and acclaimed female artists by posing with a Tate mug in front of photos of Frida Kahlo while using the colour orange to connect herself to both.Now looking at her galleries on line there are a number of sets to be seen, starting with her 'first exhibition' in 2001, which is like a blue group and then a year later there is a red group. Like the groups in the following years they seem to fit a scheme of abstraction and traditional symbols in which Hejazi was not the only one working in Saudi Arabia. Countries do have collective ideas about art. Judging from her online gallery from around 2006 the artist seems to express stronger opinions of her own design. There is more colour, more detail. And more tension, as can be seen in Missing Tattoo, the large (150 x 150 cm) painting illustrated here at the top, which works well on many levels of focus. The etching of the question mark measures only 10x10 cm and remember that Arabs read from right to left.Some of Hejazi's best paintings are part of a permanent collection by the name of Segia in Riyadh. One of them is convincingly red. (27 May 2010)."

Unilever and local importer of Japanese cars: Abdul Latif Jameel, have also worked with 181 Degrees. One wonders about the name. Is it 180 degrees reality and 1 degree the brush of Salem, or is it exactly the other way round? Never mind. Even within reality the salespeople at Daihatsu know that you can load a truck with only green melons or with all the stuff you collect in a lifetime.

"Shalima Sharbatli","http://www.greenboxmuseum.com/sa-shalimasharbatli.html","Shalima Sharbatli. So we read on the internet: in Jeddah the apples from France and the oranges from Egypt come in Sharbatli boxes and have Sharbatli stickers on them. It is no surprise then that Shalima Sharbatli informs people that she lives with art 24 hours a day. 'An instinctive Saudi painter,' she herself was branded by Arab News and having to juggle at a young age with a touch of paradise perhaps educated her with knowledge that needs discovery. No images of her artwork travel on the internet, but for the picture in Arab News of herself as an artist, revealing a pair of trousers usually reserved for the atelier, and in front of one of her large outside works in Jeddah. The latest news on her is that she is planning a joint exibition in Paris with two artists from France and Spain. Mitterand Jr. will open the show. It is indeed about finding - not building - bridges, but art is not an international language, as Shalima is quoted to have said in wonder of people who 'imprison' themselves in local subjects. Art needs a viewpoint. The very best artists have eyes at the back of their heads, instinctively. As she is reported to have said that the music made her proud, a closer look at Sharbatli's work will surely reveal some lines of the national anthem of Saudi Arabia. Perhaps the daring scale of her work is such a line and those visiting the government guesthouse in Jeddah, should look out for a 17 meter long wall painting and be the judge of it. The limited glimpse of her work in the Arab News photo reminds me of a Dutch woman of noble birth, Jacoba van Heemskerk, who's more abstract paintings were influenced by Cubism and German expressionism, and who started very much by painting with the brain and struggled to jump out. But that is not Shabatli. It looks like the paint jumped on her first."

She knows how to handle paint and learned to do so in painting classes given in Damman, Qatif and Syria. As a painter she has steadily been building a body of work, that shows she got to know the classics of modern art, which fit very well Saudi concepts that there is not much gain in trying to depict nature-true with paint. It is the modern abstaction which accepts gracefully our own failure at creation and makes the best of it. So at least could be a vision of art. A very frank Al-Bagshi shares with us however her first efforts of 2001 in her on-line gallery, which indicate she moved from a romantic sea shore vision to the inner thoughts of humans, often ruled by the moon; in form not unlike those caught in stone by Modigliani. It is in 2007 that suddenly again the sun appears and her paintings flow with colour. Then too, all figurative efforts sometimes dissolve as they did in two painted boards. It looks like the artist can now handle with wise ease anything that may sweep ashore in the Persian Gulf."

Abdelkader Benchamma imposes constraints upon his process to create delicately executed and dynamic drawings of states of matter. Events explode off the page and are animated by fusing graphic techniques from printing, engraving, landscape and scientific drawing. In his scenes he reveals the purity and intensity of lines to express powerful and ambiguous atmospheres which probe notions of a stable reality. Benchamma uses these varied techniques and media to explore the constructed aspect of reality, inspired by cosmology, science fiction literature, existentialist theatre and literature. Abdelkader Benchamma lives and works between Paris and Montpellier. He studied Fine art at l’Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Montpellier and l’Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris.

The focus of her early works was her relationship with the environment, which she expressed as several series of self-portraits in a fanciful, metaphoric world. This body of work led to other series - still ongoing – based on famous fairytales which then Riahi re-narrates in her own way.

The embroideries in Raad’s most recent series contain extracts from the poem Shah-nameh by Persian poet Ferdowsi (940-1020 CE). The poem describes existence shadowed by the horrors of demons, as well as life free of them.

Baladi applies investigations of myths, archives and personal narratives to multiple expressions and a range of mediums that include performance, architectural installations, photography, collage, tapestry, perfume and sculpture, often culminating in a monumental conclusion. Works that have emerged out of such trajectories include Don’t Touch Me Tomatoes & Chachacha for an exhibition curated by Hervé Mikaeloff and commissioned by Dior (Paris, Grand Palais, 2013), Oum el Donia (The Mother of the World) commissioned by Fondation Cartier pour l’Art Contemporain (Paris, 2000) for the exhibition Desert, as well as Roba Vecchia (Ragman), a life-sized kaleidoscope first exhibited at the Townhouse Gallery of Contemporary Art  (Cairo 2006). Qabr al Zaman (The Tomb of Time) commissioned by Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art (Qatar 2010) became the final expression for Diary of the Future. Her work Borg el Amal (Tower of Hope), an ephemeral construction and sound installation, won the Grand Nile Award at the 2008/2009 Cairo Biennale. In 2012 she collaborated with the Kiev Kamera Orchestra to perform the Donkey Symphony, Borg el Amal’s sound component, at the first Kiev Biennial. In 2003, she received a fellowship from the Japan Foundation to pursue research in Tokyo, and in 2010, took part in the VASL residency program in Karachi, Pakistan to research representations of paradise in popular iconography. Within her artistic practice, Baladi is active in socially engaged projects. She has been a member of the Arab Image Foundation since its creation in 1997. She curated several projects including the artist residency Fenenin el Rehal (Nomadic Artists) in the Libyan Desert in 2006. During the 2011 Egyptian uprising, Baladi accumulated a massive digital archive of found videos, photographs and press articles that documented the events on the ground and around the world. The artist co-founded two media initiatives in Tahrir Square as a result of these archives: Radio Tahrir and Tahrir Cinema. The growing archive has resulted in a series of works that propose a meaningful reading of chaos (including Alone, Together…In Media Res and Don’t Touch Me Tomatoes & Chachacha).

Her explicative use of the Farsi language and its poetry creates graphic and dynamic imagery, captivating regardless of one’s knowledge of the language or culture. In What Lies Beneath | Second Edition, the artist presents a series of black and white photographs entitled ‘Mountains of Alas and Regret’ and a video work. The mountainscapes, playing with Farsi words by creating landscapes from them, redefine expressions of emotion, literally and metaphorically shrouding them to create an overwhelming sense of nostalgia. Chavangalaee explores the sensation of the sublime, the pleasant pain that feats of nature arouse.

"Adel Abidin","http://nadour.org/artists/adel-abidin/","Adel Abidin’s projects twist elements of reality, creating poetic shifts in context. So in his universe, a travel agent offers a holiday to Baghdad (Abidin Travels, 2006) the artist pushes a vacuum cleaner across a snowy landscape (Vacuum 2006), some percussionists play with loaves of bread (Bread of Life, 2008), a game of Ping Pong is played on a table which has a female body for a net (Ping Pong 2009)."
"Ahmad Morshedloo","http://nadour.org/artists/ahmad-morshedloo/","Ahmad Morshedloo carefully composes large-scale oil paintings as well as pen or charcoal drawings woven with meticulous lines and hatchings. He finds his inspiration in observing daily and ordinary scenes around him. His characters are always caught at times of inaction, immobility, reflection or even sleep. The impression of familiarity is then being replaced by strangeness and realism, which serve the purposes of introspection and dramaturgy."
"Ahmed Mater","http://nadour.org/artists/ahmed-mater-al-ziad-aseeri/","Ahmed Mater was born in 1979 in a rural part of Southern Saudi Arabia. He grew up in Abha, the capital of Aseer, where he followed a career working both as an artist and as a doctor at the local hospital. As project leader of the collective Ibn Aseer (son of Aseer), he played an integral part in the Al-Miftaha Arts Village project which quickly became key to the energy of a youthful art scene celebrated in King Fahd ‘s centre of culture."
"Asgar/ Gabriel","http://nadour.org/artists/asgar-gabriel/","The dialectic of reality and Utopia is manifested in the paintings by Asgar/Gabriel. It’s the conjunction of the two ideas that creates a form of meta-reality which comes close to ours, and moreover, maintains a socio-critical stance also by painterly means. Therein, the gender-specific power relations, which have dominated hundreds of years of art history, are a major issue. Painting, on the analogy of the contentual dimension, is the intelligent sampling of different styles that change in the eye of the beholder to generate something that has been never seen before. Asgar and Gabriel stepped up to renew painting radically – without denying its past. They make use of it to take a big step forward. Thinking ahead of further societal developments – which has to be taken on globally nowadays – has always been an issue in art and ever since, art has been at least one step ahead of reality. In this sense, an update to the genre has been overdue for a long time."

"Diana al Hadid","http://nadour.org/artists/diana-al-hadid/","Between construction and deconstruction, the sculptures of Diana Al-Hadid evoke overturned buildings, collapsed structures revealing the fragility of all human undertakings, endangered by their own excesses. The artist’s influences are diverse, a mixture of Arab oral tales with the mythological epics and biblical writings, Islamic art with classical painting, Baroque with Gothic and Romanesque, the model of medieval churches with that of the tower, skyscraper and stadium, and the latest advances in physics and astronomy with the ephemeral productions of a colony of bees. Her modes of production join architectural engineering with free experiments in poetic, almost narrative form. The materials she uses are similarly diverse: concrete, plywood, fibreglass and polystyrene combine to form sculptures often built on a monumental scale."
"Djamel Kokene","http://nadour.org/artists/djamel-kokene/","Within his work, Djamel Kokene explores the tensions between language, thought and representation. Thus, he stages the written word it in many of his works, sometimes associated with objects, always in a strong conceptual stance. By drawing themes from the heart of contemporary society, the artist also readily deals with notions of identity, nationality and community, challenging them with the notions of nomadism and displacement."
"Driss Ouadahi","http://nadour.org/artists/driss-ouadahi/","Driss Ouadahi is a painter. He started with abstract colour field paintings consisting of monochrome surfaces that push into each other and overlap, yet he progressively turned to more realistic compositions. Still, it is a turn to the symbols of architecture and the urban that links all his paintings together.He paints subjects that could a priori be considered “a-picturesque”. In his work we find shells of buildings on the periphery of Algiers and Paris - typical dwellings that once brought forth pride as symbols of modernity and progress. They are now looked upon with disdain and shame and are considered utter architectural and social failures."
"Faisal Samra","http://nadour.org/artists/faisal-samra/","The work of Faisal Samra, now essentially based on photography and video, denounces the visual culture systems of mass media, advertisements or political communication and is opposed to their large scale manipulation. In the Distorted Reality series, started in 2005, he has been documenting his performances generally as large scale triptychs with a polished image, wearing masks, animals, fabrics or bandages and all kinds of artefacts twisting his face until it disappears. The viewer always implicitly feels the discomfort brought by the shock of traditions faced with the contemporary world and the difficulty to find one’s place there."
"Fayçal Baghriche","http://nadour.org/artists/faycal-baghriche/","A globe spinning so fast the continents can no longer be made out, flags wrapped around themselves, showing only their red colour, a video reversing the course of time – starting from the formulation of a hypothesis, the works of Fayçal Baghriche undermine our most familiar points of reference by staging fundamental actions. Playing on discrepancy, the artist invites us to distance a normalised reality. Mixing performance, installation, video and photography, he reveals, the better to annihilate them, the systems of identification, behavioural models or language structures that determine what we are and become a pretext for the poetic construction of another reality."
"Hayv Kahraman","http://nadour.org/artists/hayv-kahraman/","Born in Baghdad in 1981, Hayv Kahraman left Iraq at the early age of ten to live in Sweden with her family. Having studied graphic design at the Academy of Art and Design in Florence (Italy 2005), she then completed a course in web design at the University of Umea (Sweden 2006), before settling in the United States where she currently lives and works."
"Kader Attia","http://nadour.org/artists/kader-attia/","Kader Attia’s videos, installations, photographs and drawings are mostly inspired by his own life experience, and thus often refer to the difficult task of bridging different cultures. Frequently executed with objects dissociated from their original function, his work questions, in a rather direct fashion, the notions of uprooting, identity and religion as withdrawal into an exclusive community. Moreover, Attia continues his exploration of the myths and the poetry of emptiness/void."
"Lara Baladi","http://nadour.org/artists/lara-baladi/","Born in 1969 in Lebanon of Lebanese and Egyptian parents, Lara Baladi lived in Beirut, Paris and London before settling in Cairo in 1997. Drawing from the shifting borders of her identity, the artist has developed her work along her journeys and through the accumulation of images and photographs. In these installations, collages or video works, the visuals mix and recreate a hybrid universe where mythological references and symbolic systems meet, simultaneously borrowing from the Islamic heritage, Egyptian iconography and the popular or middle-class imagery. They illustrate the passage of time - the memory of the past, the trace of the present, the vision of the future - according to the personal anthropology of the artist who draws her inspiration from dreams and imagination."
"Larissa Sansour","http://nadour.org/artists/larissa-sansour/","Larissa Sansour produces work inspired by cult movies, television series and even cartoon strips, and as an artist is unafraid to plunder widely from popular culture. She mixes Spaghetti Westerns, science fiction and horror films with real life political events, related to the Palestinian situation or more generally the Middle East. By looking at a geopolitics over-burdened with conflicts, tensions and dramas, she fictionalizes situations in order to dismantle clichés or ethnic and social stereotypes. Working in video but also in installation, photography and books, she creates pieces imbued with a certain humour and with a critical aspect firmly entrenched in the contemporary sphere. Larissa Sansour also plays a curatorial role through video programming."
"Leila Pazooki","http://nadour.org/artists/leila-pazooki/","Continuously commuting between the worlds of Iran and Europe, Leila Pazooki mainly explores the concept of „borders“. Working with digital media, video and image editing, Pazooki began her early research by experimenting with visual modifications, challenging the „borders“ of visual work in terms of „acceptabillity“; the „licit“ and the“ illicit“ images."
"Mahmoud Bakhshi","http://nadour.org/artists/mahmoud-bakhshi/","By his displacement of prescriptive and symbolic signs endemic to Iranian society, Mahmoud Bakhshi has built up a subversive body of work which opposes the official rhetoric. An element of humour is essential to his art, which allows him to highlight the contradictions, indeed the irrationality which he observes around him. A graduate in sculpture at the University of Fine Arts in Tehran, the young artist born in 1977 explores various mediums: sculpture, installations, but also photography and video. Art for him is about freely translating his thoughts in the most effective way possible. Yet the subject of his “origin” always informs his work, which is made up of transpositions, arrangements and collections."
"Manal Al Dowayan","http://nadour.org/artists/manal-al-dowayan/","In her photographic series and more recently her installations, Manal Al-Dowayan examines the Saudi identity.  Questions raised by her work concern the female condition, symbols of community loyalties, technological changes and the relationship to the world that these imply.  Her art combines a graphic yet refined aesthetic: elegant portraits of women, neon writing, what would seem glamourous motifs (jewels, doves, tattoos).  But an incongruous element will always be thrown in to disturb these studied seductive scenes: (workman’s tools in the series I am,) or the direct use of a paint bomb and a stencil (And We Had No Shared Dreams)."
"Marwan Rechmaoui","http://nadour.org/artists/marwan-rechmaoui/","Beirut, capital of Lebanon and the scene of unceasingly renewed conflicts, undoubtedly constitutes the cornerstone of the last works of Marwan Rechmaoui. Along his works, he exposes the extremely complex social and political geography of his city."
"Moataz Nasr","http://nadour.org/artists/moataz-nasr-bio/","Moataz Nasr is a versatile artist who employs painting, sculpture, photography and video in order to create installations which allow the viewer a great freedom to explore. His work borrows deeply from his native Egypt. He endeavours to describe a universal phenomenon which impacts people all over the world, wherever they come from: the spread of such afflictions as solitude, impotence against the changes which are rushing ahead, to an acute feeling of abandonment. Moataz Nasr, by an elegant and poetic approach really takes up the position as an observer of the far-reaching transformations which are affecting the contemporary world, and his numerous references to traditional culture only serve to underline these issues."
"Mohamed Bourouissa","http://nadour.org/artists/mohamed-bourouissa/","Since 2002, Mohamed Bourouissa has been developing a fine art photography practice but also drawing and video works deeply rooted in social reality. Primarily working around representations of a contemporary urban environment, the artist is interested in geographical and social spaces usually represented by stereotypes. Suburbs (Périphérique, 2005-2008), prison (Temps mort, 2009) or television (the Ecran series, 2007)."
"Mouna Karray","http://nadour.org/artists/mouna-karray/","The photographer Mouna Karray strives to make places and everyday objects “speak”. Should her chosen medium halt “at the surface” of things ontologically, the artist seeks to restore the complexity of the spaces that she encounters (be they domestic or urban, private or public) by going beyond superficial appearance and definition. In order to document the” real”, but above all to make the sense and identity of it apparent, the artist works in series. This exploratory method allows for expansion: from motivation to context, from anecdote to memory. On several occasions, in order to tackle the sensitive territory of the personal, Mouna Karray has expanded into other media: for example in the installation El’mech’ed, 2004 and the sound piece An object on the Shore, 2007."
"mounir fatmi","http://nadour.org/artists/mounir-fatmi/","mounir fatmi’s installations, sculptures, videos, photographs, paintings and drawings audaciously tease and confront proprieties. He questions, plays and provokes with caustic insolence, taking on notions of power, and all kinds of extremism; the religious, the political, as well as their means; architecture and media.He selects rather basic materials, often on the verge of extinction (as with the VHS cassettes and the coaxial cable), yet as seen with the saw blades or wooden horse jumps, they always elicit relevant connotations. Although aesthetically very seductive, mounir fatmi’s work offers a look at the world from another angle, refusing to be blinded by conventions."
"Nida Sinnokrot","http://nadour.org/artists/nida-sinnokrot/","Nida Sinnokrot is a filmmaker and an installation artist. His work is very reflective of his hybrid identity and personal experience. Of Palestinian origin, Sinnokrot grew up in Algeria and moved to the United States of America as a teenager. Nevertheless, his films, installations and sculptures increasingly explore the traumas generated by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"Ninar Esber","http://nadour.org/artists/ninar-esber/","Based on personal experience –of womanhood but also coming from a certain elevation and slow languor –Ninar Esber’s work touches profoundly upon the notion of identity whilst tracing a poetic vision of the world. The artist uses the human body as an element to support a collective symbolism, made to work in relation to architecture and everyday objects in order to play on the notion of context, in the social, interpersonal even political sense of the term. In her photographs, videos and performances, the sensuality which runs through her work questions genres, morality and their authority. Thus, she makes use of stereotypes in order to better criticize them: the pin-up and the Hollywood star (the performance On the Rooftop of Kom Ghrab in 2008, the series of photographs NMM and also Pin-up) superheros (FEMALE, 2009), cultural symbols (Colours, Arlesienne), etc."
"Oraib Toukan","http://nadour.org/artists/oraib-toukan/","Oraib Toukan works across media in photography, video, text and installation, often using politics and current affairs as source material. She often presents wry and playful critique in the form of subtle interventions with institutions ranging from Wikipedia to Christie’s."
"Pantea Rahmani","http://nadour.org/artists/pantea-rahmani/","Born in 1971, Panthea Rahmani studied visual arts at the University of Teheran, her birthplace. From this time on, inspired by Balthus, Giacometti or Modigliani, the artist developed an interest in portraits, which she has been producing through painting or drawing."
"Pascal Hachem","http://nadour.org/artists/pascal-hachem/","The work of Pascal Hachem, whether through performances or installations, often starts with a diversion. Trained as an engineer, his knowledge of engines and materials give him a particular stance which he applies in creating artefacts and (often mechanized) installations. He uses daily objects and manages to extract their nature and their primary identity thanks to unusual associations and layouts. These machines inevitably cause a feeling of strangeness but paradoxically appear strangely familiar to whoever looks at them. A series of hammers slowly destroying a wall in a paced and almost liturgical motion, a t-shirt gradually torn under the weight of an accumulation of sand, knives gently emerging from a desert. These devices all unsettle the viewer whilst entailing issues of a political, social or environmental nature."
"Ramin Haerizadeh","http://nadour.org/artists/ramin-haerizadeh/","The paintings of Ramin Haerizadeh are a hybrid, a telescoping of found photographs and lascivious or vociferating self-portraits. He first organises these images on the canvas, then recovers or smudges them with acrylic paint. This results in sumptuous polychrome compositions, between kitsch and black humour, between ornamentation and Dadaist subversion. The austere and belligerent emblems of the Islamic power meet the sumptuous iconography associated with the Pahlavi dynasty, highlighting the irrational succession of ideological and cultural paradigms in contemporary Iran."
"Reza Aramesh","http://nadour.org/artists/reza-aramesh/","Reza Aramesh’s soon found his medium of predilection in photography - ideal form in which to meld his interest in the history of painting, film and literature with modern society and politics.In his series entitled, Between the Eye and the Object Falls a Shadow…, Aramesh freezes in black and white re-enacted scenes of disputes that took place in the Middle East or in Vietnam from the 1960 to the present day. These classic and dramatic scenes found their incongruous setting in lavish British homes and historical museums. This audacious subversion of space and time came to the fore in Aramesh’s Action 71. Here, Aramesh invited homeless individuals to spend their night in selected rooms of the Tate Britain, sleeping with portraits produced between the seventeenth and eighteenth century representing individuals that focused on status and lineage."
"Rula Halawani","http://nadour.org/artists/rula-halawani/","Rula Halawani shoots and produces images of the changes taking place daily on the Palestinian territory. She explains “I am an artist, a photographer who lives and works in an intensely political environment (…) the question of making political art does not arise in the Palestinian context. Our existence is entirely defined, at all levels, by political circumstances. ”"
"Saâdane Afif","http://nadour.org/artists/saadane-afif/","In his work, Saâdane Afif favours a playful yet eclectic approach, which he tends to share with other artists from across the spectrum, involving musicians along with critics and writers. His working method is based on the idea of keeping the outcome open to all possibilities throughout the production of the piece, up until the final result. Whilst moving away from a more egotistic approach the artist quotes widely from other artists, involving materials and forms in a transformation cycle which is part of an entire process: his pieces are retrieved in order to be re-interpreted by other artists, in texts, musical scores, live performances, which produces new and dynamic objects which are hard to classify. Saâdane Afif thus maintains a great freedom in his method, swinging between a formal levity and a subtlety with underlying issues. He asks that the spectator think about the space he occupies in relationship to the artwork and its status."
"Sama Alshaibi","http://nadour.org/artists/sama-al-shaibi-bio/","Sama Alshaibi is an artist born in 1973, in Basra, Iraq to an Iraqi father and Palestinian mother and is now a naturalized US citizen."
"Sara Rahbar","http://nadour.org/artists/sara-rahbar/","Sara Rahbar was born in Tehran in 1976, shortly before the Iranian Revolution and the Iran-Iraq war, as a result of which her family was forced to leave the country. She grew up in the United States as part of the Iranian diaspora. She studied fashion and design at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York (1999-2000), and then visual arts at Central Saint-Martin’s College in London (2004-5)."
"Sirine Fattouh","http://nadour.org/artists/Sirine-Fattouh/","Sirine Fattouh puts into perspective the profound effects left by the war on Lebanon, her country of birth. She fled the combat with her entire family in 1989. Her work questions the way in which her memories have formed through the connections that she has renewed with her country since her exile. It also examines the collective memory of the Lebanese who have remained there, which plays a determining role in the make-up of their current identity. Bearing this in mind, she elects a stripped-down art form, which approaches the style of a documentary, and almost resembles archive material in its elimination of any fictional or aesthetic element in order to force the viewer to face up to the reality which confronts them. Sirine Fattouh means however to imprint a political dimension into her work: for example, in Perdu/Gagné, she gives a voice to the Lebanese women “who have rarely if ever had the chance to utter or express their own opinion.”"
"Taysir Batniji","http://nadour.org/artists/taysir-batniji/","Trained as a painter, but also a creator of installations and performances, since the 1990s Taysir Batniji has worked mainly with video and photography, two “light” mediums that fit with a career which has involved much travelling to and from between Palestine and Europe. He documents Palestinian reality in a physically vivid, anti-spectacular way by focusing on displacement, intermediate states, and the inhibition of movement. These objective issues which are part and parcel of the social, political and cultural context in Palestine also reflect the position of the artist as a witness and contributor to the life of his country, but also the Western art scene."
"Wafa Hourani","http://nadour.org/artists/wafa-hourani/","Born in 1979 in Hebron in Palestine, Wafa Hourani now lives and works in Ramallah. Deeply marked by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the future of the Middle East, the artist develops a work which reveals the social, political and economical context of life in Palestine."
"Walid Raad","http://nadour.org/artists/walid-raad/","Born in 1967 in Chbanieh in the Lebanon, Walid Raad is an artist whose work reflects the troubled history of his country of origin, which he has witnessed since childhood. By collecting, modifying and creating photographs, texts and videos, he plays on the idea of the document as it relates to the civil war and the troubles between communities which have shaken this territory. The artist infuses his depictions with a cloudiness intended to throw doubt on the notion of documentation itself, and posing a profound question about how History is constructed. His working method involves artistic processes such as montage, hijacking and displacement which he uses to create his poetic, semantic distortions against the backgrounds he manipulates."
"Yazid Oulab","http://nadour.org/artists/yazid-oulab/","Informed by the issues surrounding Western Art, drawing from a literary and poetic tradition, the work of Yazid Oulab is a quest for meaning. In his sculptures, videos, installations and also his drawings, the artist declines an iconography linked to his own experience: everyday objects (jars, scales, crates, carpets) , sometimes with a sacred association (incense sticks, sacrificial knives), or to the building trade which he practised in order to finance his studies (trowel, carpenter’s pencil, scaffolding)."
"Younès Rahmoun","http://nadour.org/artists/younes-rahmoun/","Younès Rahmoun was born in 1975 in Tetouan, in Morocco, where he currently lives and works.

"Youssef Nabil","http://nadour.org/artists/youssef-nabil-bio/","Brought up on the great era of Egyptian cinema Youssef Nabil retains a feeling of nostalgia for the glamorous aestheticism of the ‘40s and ‘50s. Born in Egypt in 1972, he grew up in the streets of Cairo where hand-painted cinema posters gave the walls a timeless elegance, whilst classics from a past era shown on television were to inspire his first love of the big screen."
"Zena el Khalil","http://nadour.org/artists/zena-el-khalil/","Zena El Khalil uses a very personal visual language, marked by disillusion, irony and romance. Her universe illustrates the madness and contrasts of a city like Beirut, where war is always latent and where bombs punctuate people’s existence."
"Ziad Antar","http://nadour.org/artists/ziad-antar/","His videos undeniably testify to a world in conflict, but using a rather playful and light tone, Ziad Antar’s work immediately seduces.Focusing on a precise idea, Ziad Antar’s videos express life problems (sometimes linked to war) with a short shot and with simple means. It is with disconcerting ease and efficiency that Ziad Antar confronts the viewer with burning questions, without expressing any position and without empathy."
"Zoulikha Bouabdellah","http://nadour.org/artists/zoulikha-bouabdellah/","French-Algerian artist born in 1977 in Moscow, Zoulikha Bouabdellah grew up in Algiers until the civil war forced her to leave her country and come to settle in France with her family in 1993. Her work based on transgression, draws its inspiration from this plural identity. Through installations, videos or photographs and the notion of otherness, the works of Zoulikha Bouabdellah question our dominant political, social, moral, religious or even formal representations."
"Diana Al-Hadid","http://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/diana_hadid.htm?section_name=unveiled","Diana Al-Hadid is a Syrian-American artist who lives and works in New York. Her sculptures take ‘towers’ as their central theme, drawing together a wide variety of associations: power, wealth, technological and urban development, ideas of progress and globalism. They are also – both in legends such as the Tower of Babel, and reality, such as the horrors of the World Trade Centre attacks – symbols of the problems of cultural difference and conflict. Al-Hadid’s Tower of Infinite Problems poses as a toppled skyscraper. Made from crude materials such as plaster, Styrofoam, wax, and cardboard, her structure is a monument to human fallibility. Sprawling on the floor like an imaginary archaeological find, the sculpture places the viewer in a fictional role as futuristic observer, mourning the tragic follies of a past (our current) civilization. If viewed from the end, the two parts of the structure converge in an optical illusion, creating a spiral vortex suggesting a cyclical repetition of history."
"Amina Menia","http://www.taymourgrahne.com/artists/amina-menia","Amina Menia, born in Algiers in 1976, is a multi-media artist whose ouevre combines both sculpture and installation. Her work questions the relation to architectural and historical spaces, and challenges conventional notions around the exhibition space. With a minimal lexicon, she underlines historical places, revisits urban legends, points out urban gaps by ephemeral interventions. Working across installation and sculpture, her art encourages exchange and attempts to probe social changes through “daily urban practices.”"
"Fayçal Baghriche","http://www.taymourgrahne.com/artists/fayal-baghriche","Born in Algeria in 1972, Paris-based artist Fayçal Baghriche grew up navigating between Arab and Western cultures, forming his artistic perspective characterized by the blurring of distinct cultural lenses. By illuminating the simplicity of movement and modifying image fundamentals, his craft creates a body of works that challenges the frameworks of society. Baghriche's performances, installations and photographs emulate scenes from daily life, illuminating the stereotypes of both human conduct and expression. He introduces slight discrepancies to unveil the instinctive nature of language and behavior, distancing what is considered an ordinary reality. Calling upon poetry and humor, the artist shapes his practice by embodying a precise state of mind, which he aims at the stimulation of critical thought. Baghriche received a Fine Arts diploma from La Villa Arson, Nice, a B.A. in Dramatic Arts from Sophia Antipolis, Nice, and an MA in Multimedia Creation from the National School of Fine Arts, Paris. His work has been shown in numerous exhibitions in France and internationally. He has participated in Brooklyn Euphoria, New York, and Dashanzi International Art Festival, Beijing. He has shown his work in Outpost for Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Bielefelder Kunstverein, Germany; Al Riwaq Art Space, Bahrain and The Museum of Modern Art of Algiers, Algeria. He was included in La force de l’Art in 2009, and took part in Nuit Blanche, Paris, and Le Printemps de Septembre, Toulouse. In 2010 he exhibited at The Museum of Modern Art Paris, Museum of Contemporary Art Bordeaux, and Fondation Vasarely in Aix-en-Provence. In 2011, he was part of The Future of a Promise, at the 54th Venice Biennale."
"Hassan Hajjaj","http://www.taymourgrahne.com/artists/hassan-hajjaj","Born in Larache, Morocco, in 1961, Hassan Hajjaj left Morocco for London at an early age. Heavily influence by the club, hip-hop, and reggae scenes of London as well as by his North African heritage, Hajjaj is a self-taught and thoroughly versatile artist whose work includes portraiture, installation, performance, fashion, and interior design, including furniture made from recycled utilitarian objects from North Africa, such as upturned Coca-Cola crates as stools and aluminum cans turned into lamps.Turning to photography in the late 80s, Hajjaj is a master portraitist, taking studio portraits of friends, musicians, and artists, as well as strangers from the streets of Marrakech, often wearing clothes designed by the artist. These colorful and engaging portraits combine the visual vocabulary of contemporary fashion photography and pop art, as well as the studio photography of African artist Malick Sidibe, in an intelligent commentary on the influences of tradition in the interpretations of high and low branding and the effects of global capitalism. Hassan's work is in the collections of the Brooklyn Museum, New York; the British Museum, London; the Nasher Museum of Art, Duke University, Durham, NC; the Newark Museum, New Jersey; Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; the Victoria & Albert Museum, London; the Farjam Collection, Dubai; Institut des Cultures d’Islam, Paris; Kamel Lazaar Foundation, Tunisia; Virginia Museum of Fine Art, Richmond, VA, and more.

"Lamia Joreige","http://www.taymourgrahne.com/artists/lamia-joreige","Born in Lebanon in 1972, Lamia Joreige is a visual artist and filmmaker who lives and works in Beirut. She earned her BFA in Painting and Filmmaking from the Rhode Island School of Design, Providence, in 1995. She uses archival documents and elements of fiction to reflect on history and its possible narration, and the relation between individual stories and collective memory. Her practice is rooted in her country’s experience and explores the possibilities of representation of the Lebanese wars and their aftermath, particularly in Beirut, a city at the center of her imagery. Lamia Joreige's work essentially centers on Time: the recording of time, of its trace and its effects on us, underlining the process of memory and the impossibility of accessing a complete narrative. Joreige has written, directed and produced work ranging from short videos to multimedia installations and documentaries while, her practice tends to incite viewers’ active participation, adding a further level of engagement to the layers of subjective histories typically addressed in her work. Joreige is also the author of two publications Time and the Other and Ici et peut-être ailleurs, and has contributed to numerous publications and panels. She is also part of the Edgware Road project organized by the Serpentine gallery in London, and is a co-founder of the Beirut Art Center, a non-profit space dedicated to contemporary art in Lebanon. The artist’s work has been presented in prominent global institutions including the Sharjah Biennial; Venice Biennale; Goteborg Biennial; SFMOMA, San Francisco; The New Museum, New York; The Tate Modern, London; Centre Pompidou, Paris, France; Mori Art Museum, Tokyo; Mathaf, Doha; National Museum and Art Center Reina Sofia, Madrid; International Center of Photography, New York; Museum of Contemporary Art, Roskilde, Denmark; Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Berlin; Nicéphore Niépce Museum, France; Townhouse gallery, Egypt."
"Mohammed Kazem","http://www.taymourgrahne.com/artists/mohammed-kazem","Mohammed Kazem was born in Dubai, UAE, in 1969. A trained musician as well as an artist, Kazem studied painting at the Emirates Fine Arts Society, in Sharjah, UAE, attended Al Rayat Music School, in Dubai, and recently received his MFA at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. A pioneering conceptual artist, influenced by his close friend and mentor Hassan Sharif, his work touches on current global transformations in the social, political, and natural environments, and explores abstract ideas about the body, movement, space, and the natural elements. Kazem often works on simultaneous projects over extended periods of time, observing the transformations of his surroundings and the effects of time. In his photographic series Photographs with Flags, Kazem photographs himself next to flags in the desert that mark imminent construction projects, the artist’s body and physical presence bearing witness to the social and environmental change about to occur. Similarly, Kazem’s Window series documented the construction of a high-rise building from his window over the course of two years, as it slowly began to block his view and even the sky. Even within his iconic scratch paintings, time, space, and the body are all present. Since 1990 Kazem has been scratching the surface of paper in varying abstract compositions, capturing and incorporating sound, light and movement embodied on the page, which also changes and is dependent on the changing light of its surroundings.‘I am fascinated by collecting and documenting information about seemingly unimportant objects, traces of our present, within a particular environment,’ the artist writes."
"Nadia Ayari","http://www.taymourgrahne.com/artists/nadia-ayari","Nadia Ayari’s work focuses on political landscapes. Using recurring sets of protagonists, her paintings relate conceptual narratives from surrounding structures. For the fig, the character at the center of her compositions, the way through said structures is sanguine. Her recent explorations in fresco add a sculptural dimension to her richly dense surfaces and question dominant historical armatures.

"Nicky Nodjoumi","http://www.taymourgrahne.com/artists/nicky-nodjoumi","Born in Kermanshah, Iran in 1942, Nicky Nodjoumi experienced the Islamic Revolution of 1979 from the perspective of a young artist, astutely aware of the political and social upheavals of this tumultuous period in Iran’s history. Earning a Bachelor’s degree in art from Tehran University of Fine Arts before relocating to the United States in the late 1960s, Nodjoumi received his Master’s degree in Fine Arts from The City College of New York in 1974. Returning to Tehran to join the faculty of his alma mater, Nodjoumi joined his politically galvanized students in their criticism of the Shah’s regime, designing political posters inspired by the revolutionary spirit sweeping the country, only to be exiled once more in the aftermath of the revolution. This political engagement has continued to the present day. His nuanced figurative paintings engage in political discourse with a light, satirical touch, layering his personal heritage and lived experiences in Iran and the United States into scenes that resonate beyond specific historical contexts or geographical boundaries."
"Tarek Al-Ghoussein","http://www.taymourgrahne.com/artists/tarek-al-ghoussein","Born in Kuwait in 1962, Tarek Al-Ghoussein’s position as a Palestinian Kuwaiti shapes the dominant themes of identity, displacement, and structural and political control prominent in much of his work. Al-Ghoussein received his Bachelor’s degree in photography from New York University and his Master’s degree in Fine Arts from the University of New Mexico. He has taught at the American University of Sharjah and is currently a professor at New York University in Abu Dhabi. His first exhibition with Taymour Grahne Gallery opened in September 2014. His work, photographs often featuring the figure of the artist silhouetted against barren urban and desert landscapes of the region, serves as a partial allegory for the obstacles and forms of control facing Palestinians both within and exiled from the Palestinian territories, as well as troubling Western representations of Arabs as terrorists. Other series use the desert as a stage for investigating the artist’s relationship to land and place, in the midst of the rapid urban transformation witnessed in the UAE, where the artist lives. In the words of Sabine Vogel, his work goes beyond the specific, and “transforms direct political references into the existentially universal.” (Sabine Vogel, Artforum, 4.29.10)Tarek's works are in the collections of several international museums and institutions, including the British Museum, London; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; Victoria and Albert Museum, London; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Mori Art Museum, Tokyo; the Sharjah Art Foundation, Sharjah, UAE; Mathaf Museum, Qatar; and the Barjeel Art Foundation, Sharjah, among others. His work has been shown internationally at the Sharjah Art Museum, Sharjah; the 53rd Venice Biennale, Venice; the 6th Sharjah Biennial, Sharjah; the Royal Photography Museum, Copenhagen; Aperture Gallery, New York."

Through a steady career that has incorporated sculpture, photography and installation, Ala has continually returned to his initial passion of drawing and painting. The artist’s practice is informed by history, Persian mythology, science and philosophy, which he juxtaposes with contemporary and pop-culture elements – the works eventually exhibiting a collision of the past and present in a deconstruction/reconstruction of time and space."
"Amir H. Fallah","http://www.thethirdline.com/artists/amir-h-fallah/biography/","Amir H. Fallah was born in Tehran, Iran in 1979. He received his BFA from Maryland Institute College of Art in 2001 and his MFA from University of California Los Angeles in 2005.  His artistic oeuvre encompasses painting, drawing and sculpture/installation, with collage and complex patterning forming a large part of the visual vocabulary. The works are decidedly ornate but present a critical observation of the deconstruction and appropriation of portraiture in all its various forms. In his more recent body of work, aside from unraveling a different perspective to art historical portraiture traditions and the dynamics of modern day art collection and art making, he also reflects upon concerns of identity and representation that are central to his practice.

"Arwa Abouon","http://www.thethirdline.com/artists/arwa-abouon/biography/","Born in Tripoli, Libya of Libyan and Tunisian parents, Arwa Abouon is a young photographer and video artist currently based in Montreal, Canada. Through her playful photographs and graphic interventions, she questions her own place within a so-called Western culture on the one hand and her upbringing in a Muslim household on the other. Arwa investigates mechanisms at play when learning and acquiring knowledge, and the different shapes that this knowledge takes on as it is transferred from one generation to another. Balancing playful humor, irreverent re-appropriation and respectful homage, Arwa's work is always visually impactful and intricate in the subtleties within its voices. Working predominantly in photography, the artist spans a wide array of mediums, such as video, illustration, graphics on light boxes as well as the occasional site specific installation."

In merging and examining originally discrete systems and forms, asserting underlying unity as well as antagonistic elements, Babak engages a critical inquiry into cultural and socio-economical registers."

Living between Tehran and Paris,  Farhad has developed a personal language in which to discuss commonalities in Iranian and Western cultures. Inspired by Pop art, Farhad overturns both pop culture and highbrow imagery by transforming it into figurative artwork. His pieces are made using everyday objects as well as sparkly, luxurious materials such as pearls, crystals, sequins, and gold leaf. Though his work appears to be playful and decorative, beyond the shimmering surfaces Farhad casts a more cynical and often critical eye. He addresses the flaws of contemporary Iran all while toying with its traditional forms; and acknowledges the appeal of the Western world in addition to its limitations."

"Golnaz Fathi","http://www.thethirdline.com/artists/golnaz-fathi/biography/","A trained calligrapher, Golnaz Fathi has turned the literary art-form on its head by skillfully transforming known language into form and composition. She first discovered calligraphy while studying graphic design at Tehran’s Azad University, which she later left to train for six years at the Calligraphy Association of Iran. Practicing the script for over seven hours a day eventually paid off – she was the first woman to win an award for Ketabat (a genre of calligraphy) – but she soon tired of the discipline’s rules and regulations. Hence, she created a new form of expression in her paintings; an imaginary language deeply rooted in Persian tradition while simultaneously hinting at a social renaissance."

Her work combines animation and drawing in order to capture and emphasizes particular stages of the art-making process. These animations look to cinema in its juxtaposition of moving image and sounds.

"Dimi Mint  Abba","http://www.sharjahart.org/people/people-by-alphabet/a/abba-dimi-mint","Dimi Mint Abba is one of the best known members of the griot families in Mauritania, which means that Dimi Mint Abba’s place in music and storytelling preceded her by three generations. From this nest of artistry arose her profound perspective, and her life cannot be separated from the music and stories that carry it. This brought Dimi to international fame with the 1977 award-winning song “Sawt Elfan”, in which she boldly decries that the role of the artist in society is far greater than that of any warrior. Dimi released her first internationally-acclaimed album with her family in 1990 and has performed around the world.
