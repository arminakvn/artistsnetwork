Jumana  Manna,Biography
Jumana Emil  Abboud,"Jumana Emil Abboud uses drawing, video, performance, objects and text to navigate themes of memory, loss and resilience. She has consistently reflected a Palestinian cultural landscape in which the struggle for continuity amid the wider political context necessitates a constant process of metamorphosis and ingenuity. She has participated in numerous international group exhibitions over the last decade. From 2009 this included the Venice Biennale, the Istanbul Biennial, the Bahrain National Museum, Manama, L’Institut du Monde Arabe, Paris, The Jerusalem Show, and Sentences on the Banks and other Activities exhibition at Darat al Funun, Amman."

Kader Attia,"Born in Dugny, France in 1970, Kader Attia spent his childhood between France and Algeria, between the Christian Occident and the Islamic Maghreb. His work explores the impact of Western cultural and political capitalism on the Middle East and North Africa, as well as how this residual strain of struggle and resistance to colonisation impacts Arab youth, particularly in the banlieues (suburbs) of France where Attia lived. While each new series employs different materials, symbols and scale, Attia’s practice continually returns to a sustained look at the poetic dimensions and complexities of contemporary life. Recent awards include the Cairo Biennial Prize (2008) and the Abraaj Capital Art Prize (2010). Attia’s work has been widely exhibited at major international institutions including the ICA, Boston, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris and the Saatchi Gallery, London. Kader Attia is represented by Galerie Christian Nagel, Berlin and Cologne, and Galerie Krinzinger, Vienna."
Kader Attia,"Kader Attia’s videos, installations, photographs and drawings are mostly inspired by his own life experience, and thus often refer to the difficult task of bridging different cultures. Frequently executed with objects dissociated from their original function, his work questions, in a rather direct fashion, the notions of uprooting, identity and religion as withdrawal into an exclusive community. Moreover, Attia continues his exploration of the myths and the poetry of emptiness/void."
Kader Attia,"Raised in a French North African community, Kader Attia explores the complex relationship between East and West, Europe and its immigrants and the conflicts of identity that lie beneath the increasing turmoil in French society today."

In 1964, he graduated from the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome before returning to Iran where he directed numerous social documentaries for the Ministry of Culture and Art. Shirdel’s furious documentaries and cinematic language were highly contentious under the Shah as they spoke up for the underprivileged and criticised corruption. Most of his films were banned and he was expelled from the ministry. After the revolution, all his films were released in Iran and internationally. He is the founding director of the progressive Kish Documentary Film Festival, the only independent festival of its kind in Iran."

Khaled  Jarrar,Biography
Khaled  Sabsabi,"b. 1965, Tripoli, Lebanon"
Khaled Akil,"Born in Aleppo, Khaled is a self-taught Syrian photographer among the top emerging talents in his country. Focusing primarily on social, political, and sexual issues abound in the Middle East, Khaled aims to portray the 'contradictions' inherent therein, in 'a way that is acceptable to the general public'. Undoubtedly, holding a Bachelor's degree in Law and Political Science from the Beirut Arab University has enabled Khaled to further flesh out his artistic expressions of these contradictions and social issues which he observes on a daily basis. It has been his unique perspective, coupled with his undeniable talent as a photographer and artist that has garnered Khaled acclaim from his critics, and awarded him success at all his exhibitions thus far."
Khaled Al-Faisal,"Khaled Al-Faisal is a painter of the romantic style who seems to enjoy his art as a pastime. As the emir of Makkah he will realise that creation painted the birds infinitively better than his abilities allow him, but as a prince he knows that the discovery of flight was only achieved by drawing birds and observing the structure of their wings. Al-Faisal's importance for the arts of Saudi Arabia lies not in his art - his simple landscapes are the best - but in his unmitigated support for other artists during his long tenure as governor of the Aseer region. Al-Faisal has established a painting relationship with a British prince who cherishes the traditional arts. Considering the mindset of his court at Abha a comparison with Italian princes of the Renaissance seems to do Al-Faisal better justice.(20 June 2010)"
Khalid Al Gharaballi,"Khalid al Gharaballi is a stylist and artist based in New York. His work has been published in Vogue Homme Japan, V, Tokion, GQ and A magazine. Khalid is also a contributor to Bidoun and DIS Magazine. He has performed at Bidoun's Art Park at Art Dubai."
Khalid Al-Harbi,"Khalid Al-Harbi from Riyadh is a creative photographer who shows work on his personal website since 2006. There is no pretence, but for his belief in the memory of a concentrated eye. His photos are mostly of landscapes, plant and animal life. In a few instances he tries a little to enhance his images and to jump the line between photographic memory and autonomous art. A repeted focus on single flowers may be his favourite form of worship."
Khalid Khidr,Khalid Khidr is a well known Saudi photographer who from the late 1970s has captured images of the Saudi royal family and the holy sites at Makkah and Madinah as well as the development of the other cities of Saudi Arabia. He has published several books such as a book with aerial photographs of Taif and has co-operated with foreign photographers. With John French he pictured old and new Jeddah in the early 1980s.
Khalil Joreige,"Khalil Joreige and Joana Hadjithomas collaborate as visual artists and filmmakers.

Lúcia  Koch,"b. Porto Alegre, Brazil, 1966"
Laleh Khorramian,"Laleh Khorramian’s work takes theater and the spectacle as its point of departure, to explore aspects of human nature and emotional states of consciousness, and the possibilities of drawing as a medium. Her work combines animation and drawing in order to capture and emphasizes particular stages of the art-making process. These animations look to cinema in its juxtaposition of moving image and sounds. They look to drawing and printmaking for the possibilities of chance accidents, the manipulation of found material, and the mark of the human trace."
Lamia Joreige,"Born in Lebanon in 1972, Lamia Joreige is a visual artist and filmmaker who lives and works in Beirut. She earned her BFA in Painting and Filmmaking from the Rhode Island School of Design, Providence, in 1995. She uses archival documents and elements of fiction to reflect on history and its possible narration, and the relation between individual stories and collective memory. Her practice is rooted in her country’s experience and explores the possibilities of representation of the Lebanese wars and their aftermath, particularly in Beirut, a city at the center of her imagery. Lamia Joreige's work essentially centers on Time: the recording of time, of its trace and its effects on us, underlining the process of memory and the impossibility of accessing a complete narrative."

Joreige has written, directed and produced work ranging from short videos to multimedia installations and documentaries while, her practice tends to incite viewers’ active participation, adding a further level of engagement to the layers of subjective histories typically addressed in her work. Joreige is also the author of two publications Time and the Other and Ici et peut-être ailleurs, and has contributed to numerous publications and panels. She is also part of the Edgware Road project organized by the Serpentine gallery in London, and is a co-founder of the Beirut Art Center, a non-profit space dedicated to contemporary art in Lebanon.

Lamya Gargash,"In her photographic works, Lamya Gargash explores interiors as a framework for revealing issues of culture and identity in the UAE, set within the context of rapid external change."
Lani Maestro,"Lani Maestro has used a range of media including installation, sound, video, books and text to create work that explores the often complex dualities of human experience and the physical power of the natural world."
Lantian Xie,Lantian Xie was born in China and raised between Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.

Lara Baladi,"Egyptian-Lebanese artist Lara Baladi was born in Beirut, raised in Paris and educated in London. She has lived and worked in Cairo since 1997."
Lara Baladi,"Baladi is internationally recognised for an expansive body of work that crafts physical and psychological environments for audiences, a process that simultaneously creates a context and an experience. Baladi applies investigations of myths, archives and personal narratives to multiple expressions and a range of mediums that include performance, architectural installations, photography, collage, tapestry, perfume and sculpture, often culminating in a monumental conclusion. Works that have emerged out of such trajectories include Don’t Touch Me Tomatoes & Chachacha for an exhibition curated by Hervé Mikaeloff and commissioned by Dior (Paris, Grand Palais, 2013), Oum el Donia (The Mother of the World) commissioned by Fondation Cartier pour l’Art Contemporain (Paris, 2000) for the exhibition Desert, as well as Roba Vecchia (Ragman), a life-sized kaleidoscope first exhibited at the Townhouse Gallery of Contemporary Art  (Cairo 2006). Qabr al Zaman (The Tomb of Time) commissioned by Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art (Qatar 2010) became the final expression for Diary of the Future. Her work Borg el Amal (Tower of Hope), an ephemeral construction and sound installation, won the Grand Nile Award at the 2008/2009 Cairo Biennale. In 2012 she collaborated with the Kiev Kamera Orchestra to perform the Donkey Symphony, Borg el Amal’s sound component, at the first Kiev Biennial. In 2003, she received a fellowship from the Japan Foundation to pursue research in Tokyo, and in 2010, took part in the VASL residency program in Karachi, Pakistan to research representations of paradise in popular iconography. Within her artistic practice, Baladi is active in socially engaged projects. She has been a member of the Arab Image Foundation since its creation in 1997. She curated several projects including the artist residency Fenenin el Rehal (Nomadic Artists) in the Libyan Desert in 2006. During the 2011 Egyptian uprising, Baladi accumulated a massive digital archive of found videos, photographs and press articles that documented the events on the ground and around the world. The artist co-founded two media initiatives in Tahrir Square as a result of these archives: Radio Tahrir and Tahrir Cinema. The growing archive has resulted in a series of works that propose a meaningful reading of chaos (including Alone, Together…In Media Res and Don’t Touch Me Tomatoes & Chachacha). Today, Baladi is developing the project Archiving a Revolution in the Digital Age. Born from the wealth of content generated on and about the Egyptian revolution, this collaboration with universities and cultural institutions, and under the umbrella of the Arab Image Foundation, will map archives of the Egyptian revolution and create a portal to make them accessible to the public. Her works can be found in a number of institutional and private collections including Fondation LVMH, Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art (Qatar), Bulgari (Italy), Chase Collection (New York), Fondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain (Paris), Kamel Lazaar Foundation (Tunisia), Pori Museum (Finland), among others."
Lara Baladi,"Born in 1969 in Lebanon of Lebanese and Egyptian parents, Lara Baladi lived in Beirut, Paris and London before settling in Cairo in 1997. Drawing from the shifting borders of her identity, the artist has developed her work along her journeys and through the accumulation of images and photographs. In these installations, collages or video works, the visuals mix and recreate a hybrid universe where mythological references and symbolic systems meet, simultaneously borrowing from the Islamic heritage, Egyptian iconography and the popular or middle-class imagery. They illustrate the passage of time - the memory of the past, the trace of the present, the vision of the future - according to the personal anthropology of the artist who draws her inspiration from dreams and imagination."
Lara Favaretto,Italian artist Lara Favaretto provokes and engages her audiences with work that is both playful and celebratory while paradoxically evoking the inevitability of failure and decay.
Larissa Sansour,"Born in 1973 in Jerusalem to a Palestinian father and a Russian mother, Sansour studied Fine Arts in Copenhagen, where she currenlty lives and works."
Larissa Sansour,"Larissa Sansour produces work inspired by cult movies, television series and even cartoon strips, and as an artist is unafraid to plunder widely from popular culture. She mixes Spaghetti Westerns, science fiction and horror films with real life political events, related to the Palestinian situation or more generally the Middle East. By looking at a geopolitics over-burdened with conflicts, tensions and dramas, she fictionalizes situations in order to dismantle clichés or ethnic and social stereotypes. Working in video but also in installation, photography and books, she creates pieces imbued with a certain humour and with a critical aspect firmly entrenched in the contemporary sphere. Larissa Sansour also plays a curatorial role through video programming."
Latifa  Echakhch,"b. 1974, El Khansa, Morocco"
Laurent Grasso,"The work of Laurent Grasso has developed from his fascination with electromagnetic energy, radio waves, light, sound, paranormal activity and naturally occurring scientific phenomena."
Lawrence Abu Hamdan,"London based artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan’s work attempts to measure the contemporary relationship between listening and politics, borders, human rights, testimony, truth and international law, through the production of longer narrative audio documentaries and essays, audio-visual installations, graphic design, sculpture, photography, workshops and performance."
Lawrence Weiner,Art is the empirical fact of the relationships of objects to objects in relation to human beings and not dependant upon historical precedent for either use or legitimacy.

Leila Fatemi,"Leila Fatemi is a Toronto-based photographer of Iranian, German, and Indian descent. Currently completing her B.F.A. in Photography at Ryerson University, Leila is influenced by her own life experience and understandings as a visual artist living between cultures. Her work results from personal reflections as well as the attempt to create a better understanding and appreciation for Islamic culture and its foundations. Through the perspective of a practicing Muslim artist, she strives to create thought-provoking work that allows viewers to look at alternative perspectives of Islamic traditions."
Leila Pazooki,"Continuously commuting between the worlds of Iran and Europe, Leila Pazooki mainly explores the concept of „borders“. Working with digital media, video and image editing, Pazooki began her early research by experimenting with visual modifications, challenging the „borders“ of visual work in terms of „acceptabillity“; the „licit“ and the“ illicit“ images."
Lili Dujourie,"Since the late 1960s Lili Dujourie has explored a wide range of media including video, sculpture, photography and installation. Her collected video works (1972-1981) are considered seminal feminist works."
Liliana Porter,"Liliana Porter uses a whimsical collection of toys and figurines of animals and people to populate work that, with wit and a wry sense of humour, offers a metaphor of the human condition."
"Lina Gazzaz,","Lina Gazzaz, who was raised in the holy city of Makkah, was a creative consultant in advertising, who ventured on defining a new style of Islamic art by painting it herself. To show loyalty and admiration for the prophet Muhammad, this is what she aims for in her paintings of his mosque in Madinah. They were exhibited in Jeddah's International Fine Arts Hall in 2008. Gazzaz is said have made them with 'broad strokes of love and reverence.' Apart from this important mosque and other buildings she paints portraits and figures and even adventured into painting a reclining female 'kind of' nude, which, for the lack of feet or a full head, would fit nicely in any program the Louvre might have to show Michaelangelo's Slaves in a warm Arabian bed."
Liu Wei,"Liu Wei works with a range of media and styles to trace recurrent themes in his practice to personal experience, memory and the realities of a rapidly changing China."
Lize Mogel,"Lize Mogel is an interdisciplinary artist who works with the interstices between art and cultural geography. She creates and disseminates counter-cartography - maps and mappings that produce new understandings of social and political issues. Her recent projects rethink popular representations of a world shaped by global economies. She has participated in exhibitions at PS1, New York City, Casco, Utrecht, the Gwangju Biennial, South Korea, and the touring exhibition Experimental Geography."
Luc  Sante,"Luc Sante has been a writer for almost three decades.

Lulwah Al-Homoud,"Lulwah Al-Homoud is designing a new path from the roots of our earliest thinking to the present and, who knows, the end or a final idea. She does so without talking and without the help of preachers or diplomats. She simply uses mathematics, Islamic mathematics and mathematics which were there already, to recalculate the essential words of creation. 'She calls it The Language of Existence,' somebody wrote, so it is, if she did so. Its alphabet exists of the 99 most beautiful names of Allah, which Al-Homoud is 'deconstructing and recallibrating' into patterns reminicent of Islamic geometry. The new patterns interestingly include, from the moment of the first human cell devision, all brothers born before and after Abraham. So we see, believe and calculate her work."
Luz Maria  Bedoya,"b. 1969, Talara, Peru Lives and works in Lima, Peru"
Lynn Love,"Lynn Love has been writing about science and art for 15 years, and is based in New York City. In 2010 she launched the science and culture project, hergenius.org."

Magdi Mostafa,"b. 1982, Tanta, Egypt"
Maha Al-Khalawi,"Maha Al-Khalawi (1982)is a name you will find on a card sent to you because of Ramadan or other days of Islamic obligation and celebration. She is a graphic designer connected to the world in the Khatt Foundation network for Arabic Typography. There she also posted a cartoon, which she made as a freshman, showing four moments in a day of an average Saudi man. After work, traffic jams, behind a pick-up truck with sheep, and avoiding wife and children, the man relaxes among other men with waterpipe, stories and cards. There is also an icon she made of herself, wearing sunglasses, in a grafitti stenciling workshop. The grafitti stencil is only the second selfportrait, by a Saudi living in Saudi Arabia, which I discovered. The other being that of Dia Aziz Dia. More of Al-Khalawi's work can be seen on the Khatt network and she is there because simply:""I love design. I find Arabic and Bilingual design even more facinating.""An 'Eid Mubarak' card she designed for Oasis Magazine arrived today on this editor's desk. (October 3, 2009)"
Maha Maamoun,"Working primarily with the mediums of photography and video, Maha Maamoun often starts from generic visual representations of Cairo to explore how these intersect with, and are negotiated by, personal experiences."
Maha Malluh,"Maha Malluh is a Saudi artist, born in the traditional region of Najd, who explores the challenges of modernity that have come so overwhelmingly to Saudi Arabia. She has exhibited since 1976 and has in later years acquired a BA in English literature and a Californian certificate in design and photography."

She has exhibited her art since 1976 and has in later years acquired a BA in English literature and a Californian certificate in design and photography."
Mahdi Al Jeraibi,"Mahdi Al Jeraibi (1969) works as an art teacher in Mecca where children write and scratch, but hardly draw on their school desks. Really, I wondered: who or what for 25 years made these children not mix rabbits and automobiles with their doodle writing and daydream scratching? It is what we should do: wonder and ask. It is the artist who wants us to. About the school desks which he collected and presented as readymades for the audience to place on a wall. 'ALL WERE HERE,' it read about the desks and note that the exhibition was in Jeddah and not in Mecca. The artist wants dialogue about our memories. He presumes we can do so in a Socratic manner, disagreeing and convincing each other, using points of reference which work for us all. He wants us to explain and argue about traces of our past, which he simply picks up from the floor or out of the school's backyard. In a way he wants us to go back in time as if we were to cut off our hair; and then he will collect it and remind us that we will grow it back again, unable to change its colour or substance. It changes only slowly with the passing of generations. So is there no point in painting it for any future? Actually there is. Dark haired people who paint their hair blond, lure their partner's blond hair genes into changing direction. So I read somewhere in a scientific paper. In the end the dialectic argument aims to convince. But on the rational level, in the educated world, in the world of Mahdi Al-Jeraibi, in the world of Saudi Arabia's first conceptual artist, we should be optimistic about the potential of art to achieve faster results. Convincing in Al Jeraibi's Mecca is possible on, well, a moments notice, simply by listening and allowing yourself to be convinced. Of his art perhaps. Of his sombre Zincographs which are as far removed from golden palms in Dubai hotels as one can possibly imagine. They are of the moon, rather than of the sun - there is no real zinc involved -  shining a dark light on the crossing over of religious rituals of pilgrims, superstitions which survive in Mecca and a fear we have of a know known future of using DNA to recreate. The Zincographs are sculptered paintings: large wooden frames in which the artist has fixated hair he has collected of a variaty of people in a thick plate of hot wax. They are reminicent of ancient Egyptian wax portraits to a conceptual mind only. The hair he used he collected both from anonymous pilgrims - beware of Mecca barbers selling clones - and from individuals he knows well and managed to convince. As one of them is said to be his wife, there is a question that arises in the mirror of memories. Will Al Jeraibi, when his wife's hair is eventually used to clone, be the first Pygmalion to have succeed in giving true life himself to a women of his perfect imagination? We should grant her that. The artist himself is the object of imagination too. The Foundation Al Mansouria who has supported him against the dragons of misunderstanding and disinterest has put him forward as a 'model for the quest of the young and serious.' We should grant them that too. (September 30, 2009)."
Mahmoud Bakhshi,"Born 1977, Tehran, Iran"
Mahmoud Bakhshi,"By his displacement of prescriptive and symbolic signs endemic to Iranian society, Mahmoud Bakhshi has built up a subversive body of work which opposes the official rhetoric. An element of humour is essential to his art, which allows him to highlight the contradictions, indeed the irrationality which he observes around him. A graduate in sculpture at the University of Fine Arts in Tehran, the young artist born in 1977 explores various mediums: sculpture, installations, but also photography and video. Art for him is about freely translating his thoughts in the most effective way possible. Yet the subject of his “origin” always informs his work, which is made up of transpositions, arrangements and collections."

Manal Al Dowayan,"Manal AlDowayan was born and raised in the Eastern Province, the heartland of the Saudi oil industry. She has had a varied and non-structured educational background in photography, studying first in Saudi Arabia, then Dubai, Bahrain, and London. In 2010, AlDowayan was a resident artist at Cuadro Fine Art Gallery in Dubai, and in 2011, she was a resident artist at The Townhouse Gallery in Egypt. She is currently part of the British Council International Cultural Leaders programme."
Manal Al Dowayan,"In her photographic series and more recently her installations, Manal Al-Dowayan examines the Saudi identity.  Questions raised by her work concern the female condition, symbols of community loyalties, technological changes and the relationship to the world that these imply.  Her art combines a graphic yet refined aesthetic: elegant portraits of women, neon writing, what would seem glamourous motifs (jewels, doves, tattoos).  But an incongruous element will always be thrown in to disturb these studied seductive scenes: (workman’s tools in the series I am,) or the direct use of a paint bomb and a stencil (And We Had No Shared Dreams)."
Manal Al-Harbi,http://www.greenboxmuseum.com/sa-manalalharbi.html
Manal Dowayan,"Manal Dowayan (1973)from Dhahran is not the only artist who has enjoyed looking at boats moving on an Amsterdam canal as is evident in her photo series Summer. She is surely, however, the only such artist who can and will say: I am a citizen of Saudi Arabia, not speaking on her own behalf, but informing the world of her private experiences in the general context of being a professionally working woman in Saudi Arabia. She does so with several series of black and white photographs of women she meets dealing with their Saudi heritage and daily life. I am a Mother and I am a Petroleum Engineer are self evident titles in her I am series. Dowayan, being a freelance photographer with an education in information technology, works for an oil company. She is now its creative director. In her series Beyond the veil and The Choice again women pose in front of Dowayan's camera. The choices Dowayan deals with are not mentioned but shown and numbered. The Choice V shows, for example, a woman in traditional dress holding a tennis racket. Or in Choice II, perhaps the most daring in terms of the question it seems to ask, a female hand holds a pen which has just crossed out a word on a page full of repetition. Her photographs are very popular with collectors, is what I was told by Edge of Arabia, in which exhibition she participated in both London (2008) and Venice (2009). A The Choice photo of a Saudi woman holding a steering wheel was printed in Dutch magazine Kunstbeeld as an iconic image of the exhibition, providing well for the notions people have in the Netherlands about Saudi Arabia. But, one should also have a look at her close up of feet dancing in Spanish Scenes and admire simply the elegant black and white forms beyond any context of meaning; fingers that fly like swans and do not point to any future. On the future of art in Saudi Arabia however, Dowayan has sound ideas which she expressed in Arab News. She told the paper that there should be more patronage of the arts in the Kingdom itself and not just by a government system of prizes. The country needs homegrown private foundations to sustain the arts and crafts. Says Manal Dowayan, who listens well to King Abdullah. The custodian of mosques said of Saudi women: that they are citizens of Saudi Arabia. And some of them even travel to Amsterdam. (2009)."

Mark Lombardi,"Lombardi completed a BA in Art History at Syracuse University in 1974. In 1994 he made the first of his large diagrammatic drawings that chart underhand connections between numerous figures involved in political and financial scandals. These scandals were researched by Lombardi in an exhaustive manner and stored in an extensive filing card system. Lombardi described his charts as ‘narrative structures’, ordering the complex facts of a scandal into a coherent whole and given logic by visual presentation in a manner reminiscent of corporate flow charts and systems diagrams. Lombardi came to public attention by his inclusion in a group show at the Drawing Center, New York (1997), and had his first solo exhibition, Silent Partners at the Pierogi 2000 gallery in Williamsburg (1998). A posthumous travelling exhibition and catalogue entitled Mark Lombardi: Global Networks (2003–2005) was organized by Independent Curators Inc."

Marwan Kassab Bachi  /nhttp://www.daratalfunun.org/main/resourc/exhibit/marwan/marwan.html,"""Marwan paints images of human beings, very subjective images, never individual portraits. The person portrayed is always exemplary, unique and anonymous all at once. Such images… reveal a crisis of identity, [but] they also expose its contrary: an identity with consciousness and feelings, an identity with the world. Marwan’s paintings question life and ego, touch upon the secret, and circle about it, reflecting it. Emerging in his paintings as a vision – as a""face""- the secret, disappearing, proclaims itself, vanishes. There to be seen, it again withdraws.""/n"

Moataz Nasr,"Moataz Nasr is a versatile artist who employs painting, sculpture, photography and video in order to create installations which allow the viewer a great freedom to explore. His work borrows deeply from his native Egypt. He endeavours to describe a universal phenomenon which impacts people all over the world, wherever they come from: the spread of such afflictions as solitude, impotence against the changes which are rushing ahead, to an acute feeling of abandonment. Moataz Nasr, by an elegant and poetic approach really takes up the position as an observer of the far-reaching transformations which are affecting the contemporary world, and his numerous references to traditional culture only serve to underline these issues."
Moataz Nasr,"Moataz Nasr was born in Alexandria, Egypt in 1961, and currently lives and works in Cairo. A self-taught artist with an academic background in economics, Nasr gained local recognition after receiving several awards, notably the Grand Prix at the International Cairo Biennial (2001).

Moayad Hakim,"Moayad Hakim (1981) was born into a creative family in Medina. He studied both in Medina, Billings ( Montana) and in Cairo at the Faculty of Art Education of Helwan University. He appears to be in the first place a draughtsman, using one of his own drawings of a pen as the coverphoto of his artist page on facebook. The most realistic and finished drawing posted by him on internet enjoys the perspective on his own hands and a prayer rug with an image of religious architecture. Fantasy and metamorphosis rule the design of many of his other drawings and sketches in which animals and antropomorphic forms grow unexpectedly out of each other or out of  physical objects (2012)."

Mohammed Kamel,"Mohammed Kamel (1989) used to sign his graffiti as 'Lion heart' by drawing a lion and a heart. The courage to do unusual things, is what is name stood for, but he didn't really need a name. His friends would recognize him for the quality of his work. An artist should convey a message, is what he told Saudi Gazette on winning a prize in 2009 at an organized event of 250 graffiti enthousiasts. Colour sprays only, is how Kamel defines graffiti even though he suggests a historical line back to hieroglyphics. His winning work was a window for an elderly man coming from the past to see - or should it be understand - the changes of his time."
Mohammed Kazem,"Mohammed Kazem (b. Dubai, 1969) has developed an artistic practice that encompasses video, photography and performance to find new ways of apprehending his environment and experiences. The foundations of his work are informed by his training as a musician, and Kazem is deeply engaged with developing processes that can render transient phenomena, such as sound and light, in tangible terms. Often positioning himself within his work, Kazem responds to geographical location, materiality and the elements as a means to assert his subjectivity, particularly in relation to the rapid pace of modernisation in the Emirates since the country’s founding."
Mohammed Kazem,"Mohammed Kazem was born in Dubai, UAE, in 1969. A trained musician as well as an artist, Kazem studied painting at the Emirates Fine Arts Society, in Sharjah, UAE, attended Al Rayat Music School, in Dubai, and recently received his MFA at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. A pioneering conceptual artist, influenced by his close friend and mentor Hassan Sharif, his work touches on current global transformations in the social, political, and natural environments, and explores abstract ideas about the body, movement, space, and the natural elements. Kazem often works on simultaneous projects over extended periods of time, observing the transformations of his surroundings and the effects of time. In his photographic series Photographs with Flags, Kazem photographs himself next to flags in the desert that mark imminent construction projects, the artist’s body and physical presence bearing witness to the social and environmental change about to occur. Similarly, Kazem’s Window series documented the construction of a high-rise building from his window over the course of two years, as it slowly began to block his view and even the sky. Even within his iconic scratch paintings, time, space, and the body are all present. Since 1990 Kazem has been scratching the surface of paper in varying abstract compositions, capturing and incorporating sound, light and movement embodied on the page, which also changes and is dependent on the changing light of its surroundings.‘I am fascinated by collecting and documenting information about seemingly unimportant objects, traces of our present, within a particular environment,’ the artist writes."

Mona Hatoum is represented by White Cube, London."
Mona Hatoum,"Hatoum’s work is an outstanding example of the interweaving of ethical, political and aesthetic issues, whose beauty lies in the wit, economy, risk-taking and even mischief-making with which these issues are conflated . . . .In Hatoum’s deceptively simple works, defiance cannot easily be separated from vulnerability, order from chaos, beauty from revulsion, the brain from the body, the self from the other, affirmation from negation, form from content, light from dark."

Mostafa’s work has been extensively exhibited in Iran since 2004, visiting a wide variety of galleries. Choobtarash’s work has a similar approach to graffiti art with traits such as sharp criticism, protest, humour and even destruction. The main theme of his paintings give one the impression that all the depicted historical, political and social characters, events, elements and symbols, have been attacked by a humorous blow, relieving the audience from their heavy load and allowing them to see the scenes in a comical manner."

Mouna Karray,"Born in Sfax (Tunisia) in 1970, Mouna Karray studied cinema and photography in Tunis (1989-1993) and in Tokyo (1997-2002). During her time in Japan her work followed an autobiographical route, with notably the series Tokyo my Love (2001) and Identity at Stake (2002, current). The artist has also taught photography and curated exhibitions In Tunisia. She has been received as resident at the Centre d’Art Vivant at Rades (Tunisia) in 2004, at the Cite Internationale des Arts (Paris) in 2005, and at the Civitella Ranieri Foundation (Umbria, Italy) in 2007."
Mouna Karray,"The photographer Mouna Karray strives to make places and everyday objects “speak”. Should her chosen medium halt “at the surface” of things ontologically, the artist seeks to restore the complexity of the spaces that she encounters (be they domestic or urban, private or public) by going beyond superficial appearance and definition. In order to document the” real”, but above all to make the sense and identity of it apparent, the artist works in series. This exploratory method allows for expansion: from motivation to context, from anecdote to memory. On several occasions, in order to tackle the sensitive territory of the personal, Mouna Karray has expanded into other media: for example in the installation El’mech’ed, 2004 and the sound piece An object on the Shore, 2007."

mounir fatmi,"mounir fatmi’s installations, sculptures, videos, photographs, paintings and drawings audaciously tease and confront proprieties. He questions, plays and provokes with caustic insolence, taking on notions of power, and all kinds of extremism; the religious, the political, as well as their means; architecture and media.He selects rather basic materials, often on the verge of extinction (as with the VHS cassettes and the coaxial cable), yet as seen with the saw blades or wooden horse jumps, they always elicit relevant connotations. Although aesthetically very seductive, mounir fatmi’s work offers a look at the world from another angle, refusing to be blinded by conventions."
Mounira Al Solh,"The work of Mounira Al Solh is playfully conceptual. Al Solh makes videos, installations, magazines, photographs, paintings and performances. Starting from the personal, or the autobiographical, the work stretches to open up specific micro-social and micro-aesthetic questions, masking back and concealing the personal and the autobiographical. She frequently reflects on specific artworks, by appropriating them and studying them carefully, and often metamorphoses into other characters, such as various other “selves”. In Past of the Coming Days, the Sharjah Biennial (2009) Performance & Film Programme she presented The Sea is a Stereo, an ongoing project comprising video and installation."
Muhamad Haider,"Muhamad Haider is a painter from Jeddah and president of the Saudi House of Artists. His work can be seen in galleries on his personal website. There is also a list of selected group and solo exhibitions since 1999 both at home and abroad. The galleries on his website show a variety of approaches to the art of catching our eye, that the artist used over changing periods of time. In the first gallery are images of his early works which were made before 1999 when he was endeavouring to paint reality. Then his second gallery (1999-2001) is more interesting. While some Saudi artists seem to make this conscious decision to paint in an abstract style, it is evident from his work that Haider went to the Jeddah coastline and bathed his eyes in the chaotic behavior of waves that meet the shore. From this his painting may have turned to abstraction by a longing to join the swim. Great painters like William Turner would have given a nod of approval. But this avenue Haider did not pursue for long. In 2002 he turned into the desert with a style of slight abstraction with references to Saudi traditions and religion. What abstraction is there in an Arab horseguard, but for speed and what more abstraction is needed than the truth in an image of Kaaba? After 2005 Haider leaves this style again and comes up with a range of experiments. But he keeps with him his deconstruction of a traditional ornament. Have a look at the journey of the triangles in his paintings and how the black ones keep their distance and stick together.       "

Nasser Al Maimoon,"Nasser Al Maimoon is an initially self taught calligrapher born in Riyadh. He perfected his art by correspondence and travel. And perhaps by patience and effort. Having looked for teachers abroad in Turkey and Egypte - hence the flowery decoration, I presume - he also received training from Saudi calligrapher Abdullah Riza."
Nasser Al-Salem,"Nasser Al-Salem (b. 1984 in Mecca) studied Architecture at Um al Kora University in Mecca and and has expanded his creative ability into his calligraphic practice. The art of giving form to signs is expressive, harmonious and skillful. The story of writing is one of aesthetic evolution framed within the technical skills, transmission speed and material limitations of a person, time and place. Al Nasser’s work is not only aesthetically beautiful but conceptually refined. Having grown up in Mecca, his work is heavily influenced by Islamic religion and tradition."

Nicky Nodjoumi,"Born in Kermanshah, Iran in 1942, Nicky Nodjoumi experienced the Islamic Revolution of 1979 from the perspective of a young artist, astutely aware of the political and social upheavals of this tumultuous period in Iran’s history. Earning a Bachelor’s degree in art from Tehran University of Fine Arts before relocating to the United States in the late 1960s, Nodjoumi received his Master’s degree in Fine Arts from The City College of New York in 1974. Returning to Tehran to join the faculty of his alma mater, Nodjoumi joined his politically galvanized students in their criticism of the Shah’s regime, designing political posters inspired by the revolutionary spirit sweeping the country, only to be exiled once more in the aftermath of the revolution. This political engagement has continued to the present day. His nuanced figurative paintings engage in political discourse with a light, satirical touch, layering his personal heritage and lived experiences in Iran and the United States into scenes that resonate beyond specific historical contexts or geographical boundaries."
Nida Sinnokrot,"Nida Sinnokrot is a filmmaker and an installation artist. His work is very reflective of his hybrid identity and personal experience. Of Palestinian origin, Sinnokrot grew up in Algeria and moved to the United States of America as a teenager.

Ninar Esber,"Based on personal experience –of womanhood but also coming from a certain elevation and slow languor –Ninar Esber’s work touches profoundly upon the notion of identity whilst tracing a poetic vision of the world. The artist uses the human body as an element to support a collective symbolism, made to work in relation to architecture and everyday objects in order to play on the notion of context, in the social, interpersonal even political sense of the term. In her photographs, videos and performances, the sensuality which runs through her work questions genres, morality and their authority. Thus, she makes use of stereotypes in order to better criticize them: the pin-up and the Hollywood star (the performance On the Rooftop of Kom Ghrab in 2008, the series of photographs NMM and also Pin-up) superheros (FEMALE, 2009), cultural symbols (Colours, Arlesienne), etc."

Al-Sharif has an interest in the representation of groups and the sculptural history of how different figures relate to each other."
Noha Al-Sharif's,"Noha Al-Sharif's intentions are entirely pure when she expresses the power of prayer in her work. She is a sculptress from Jeddah and works at night on a rooftop platform. Her inspiration is Henry Moore, and very specific his sculpture group Three Piece Reclining Figure No. 1 (1961) about which she wrote a Masters thesis. In 2004 she graduated with a Bachelor's degree from the Jeddah College of Fine Arts."

Noura Bouzo,"Noura Bouzo (1983) says her art is about the notion of not belonging, but it appears even more to be an effort to negotiate the terms of her desired homecoming. She may not be much different from the unlikely Polar man who returns from a desert journey bringing a well packed camel on to the ice. There is both danger and duality in such a venture. When the ice melts, all of home will drown with the camel. When the ice holds, the camel may freeze but the packs, they might be saved."

Ola Hejazi,"Ola Hejazi last listed education is that of soft ground etching at the Slade art school at University College of London in 2002, but credit should be given to the Saudi Art Centre in Jeddah where she first touched the oils in 1995. Hejazi, as is in the name, is a Saudi national, although born in Lebanon. She has a very adequate website and will share her appreciation of modern art and acclaimed female artists by posing with a Tate mug in front of photos of Frida Kahlo while using the colour orange to connect herself to both.Now looking at her galleries on line there are a number of sets to be seen, starting with her 'first exhibition' in 2001, which is like a blue group and then a year later there is a red group. Like the groups in the following years they seem to fit a scheme of abstraction and traditional symbols in which Hejazi was not the only one working in Saudi Arabia. Countries do have collective ideas about art. Judging from her online gallery from around 2006 the artist seems to express stronger opinions of her own design. There is more colour, more detail. And more tension, as can be seen in Missing Tattoo, the large (150 x 150 cm) painting illustrated here at the top, which works well on many levels of focus. The etching of the question mark measures only 10x10 cm and remember that Arabs read from right to left.Some of Hejazi's best paintings are part of a permanent collection by the name of Segia in Riyadh. One of them is convincingly red. (27 May 2010)."

Panos Tsagaris,"Lives and works in New York. Tsagaris received his BFA from the Emily Carr Institute of Art & Design in Vancouver, Canada. Through his work Tsagaris aims to express the emanation of the “divine” as it is reflected through the beauty and poetry of the everyday, in order to bring himself and the viewer closer to a state of catharsis. Ultimately, Tsagaris’ work selflessly captures and reflects the divine spark that exists in the human soul. He has exhibited extensively in Miami, New York, Vancouver, Athens, Berlin, Milan, Paris and Hong Kong. Recent solo show: Clothed with the Sun, Kalfayan Galleries, Athens (2012).

Pascal Hachem,"The work of Pascal Hachem, whether through performances or installations, often starts with a diversion. Trained as an engineer, his knowledge of engines and materials give him a particular stance which he applies in creating artefacts and (often mechanized) installations. He uses daily objects and manages to extract their nature and their primary identity thanks to unusual associations and layouts. These machines inevitably cause a feeling of strangeness but paradoxically appear strangely familiar to whoever looks at them. A series of hammers slowly destroying a wall in a paced and almost liturgical motion, a t-shirt gradually torn under the weight of an accumulation of sand, knives gently emerging from a desert. These devices all unsettle the viewer whilst entailing issues of a political, social or environmental nature."

Pouya Parsamagham,"Pouya Parsamagham (born Tehran, 1981) studied graphic design and film-making, and has gone on to make documentaries, short films, and installation artworks. In What Lies Beneath, following his participation last year with a group of still image light boxes, Parsamagham presents a group of light boxes of different sizes, each displaying film clips of moving figures, captured on his phone. Chasing the characters with his camera, keeping the future of each running figure ominous, incomplete, intriguing, Parsamagham creates a dramatic and mysterious narrative. The fates of the characters, gathered from different fictional events and moments in time, are intertwined into this ongoing chase. Parsamagham’s work is developing in a time when technology is facilitating the constant monitoring and tracking of individuals."

He is also a co-founder and a board member of the Beirut Art Center (BAC), Beirut. Mroué’s work often explores sensitive and complex issues related to the impact of Lebanese history and politics on the contemporary life of the nation. However, his philosophical and aesthetic enquiry into the communicative responsibility of the artist enables his work to transcend political and cultural contexts. This is at the heart of his diverse, disciplined and constantly evolving practice in which theatre, film, performance and both visual and written arts are used to connect audiences to the immediate human reality of the artist. For Past of the Coming Days Mroué presented Theatre with Dirty Feet, a theatrical performance piece on the subject of theatre and art which ultimately questioned both the nature and purpose of itself."

Ramin Haerizadeh,"Ramin Haerizadeh (b. Tehran, 1975) lives and works in Dubai."
Ramin Haerizadeh,"The paintings of Ramin Haerizadeh are a hybrid, a telescoping of found photographs and lascivious or vociferating self-portraits. He first organises these images on the canvas, then recovers or smudges them with acrylic paint. This results in sumptuous polychrome compositions, between kitsch and black humour, between ornamentation and Dadaist subversion. The austere and belligerent emblems of the Islamic power meet the sumptuous iconography associated with the Pahlavi dynasty, highlighting the irrational succession of ideological and cultural paradigms in contemporary Iran."

Reza Aramesh,"Reza Aramesh’s soon found his medium of predilection in photography - ideal form in which to meld his interest in the history of painting, film and literature with modern society and politics.In his series entitled, Between the Eye and the Object Falls a Shadow…, Aramesh freezes in black and white re-enacted scenes of disputes that took place in the Middle East or in Vietnam from the 1960 to the present day. These classic and dramatic scenes found their incongruous setting in lavish British homes and historical museums. This audacious subversion of space and time came to the fore in Aramesh’s Action 71. Here, Aramesh invited homeless individuals to spend their night in selected rooms of the Tate Britain, sleeping with portraits produced between the seventeenth and eighteenth century representing individuals that focused on status and lineage."

An episode of this work accompanied with a talk by Romeo Castellucci was screened for Past of the Coming Days.

Saâdane Afif,"In his work, Saâdane Afif favours a playful yet eclectic approach, which he tends to share with other artists from across the spectrum, involving musicians along with critics and writers. His working method is based on the idea of keeping the outcome open to all possibilities throughout the production of the piece, up until the final result. Whilst moving away from a more egotistic approach the artist quotes widely from other artists, involving materials and forms in a transformation cycle which is part of an entire process: his pieces are retrieved in order to be re-interpreted by other artists, in texts, musical scores, live performances, which produces new and dynamic objects which are hard to classify. Saâdane Afif thus maintains a great freedom in his method, swinging between a formal levity and a subtlety with underlying issues. He asks that the spectator think about the space he occupies in relationship to the artwork and its status."
Saad Bin Mohammed,"Saad Bin Mohammed was born in Jeddah in 1969. Saad's paintings - the result of a tumultuous journey of self-discovery and exploration - are what he describes as 'the essence of the Creator incarnate in creation'. As Saad admits, all his works are 'recreations of what already exists'. However, with his singular style and approach, he is able to create depictions of his turbulent inner emotions and feelings that are totally unique. 'All I am aware of is a turbulent struggle; a journey, that, as soon as it's anywhere near ending, starts all over again', says Saad. Though throughout his career Saad has been influenced by myriad artists, he attests that he doesn't 'follow' anyone; and, likewise, Saad is not an artist who wants to be 'followed', either. As Saad himself notes, 'I raise the white flag and surrender to what's within me, so it can emerge naturally without obstructing its due course. That is me. No one is to judge - they should only embrace or reject'."

Unilever and local importer of Japanese cars: Abdul Latif Jameel, have also worked with 181 Degrees. One wonders about the name. Is it 180 degrees reality and 1 degree the brush of Salem, or is it exactly the other way round? Never mind. Even within reality the salespeople at Daihatsu know that you can load a truck with only green melons or with all the stuff you collect in a lifetime. That truck needs a roof, I believe is the message. (27 May 2010)."

Born in 1974 in Tehran, Iran, Ghadirian emerged in 2000 among a generation of photographers prepared to tackle the confusing reality of a woman’s place in contemporary Iran and to play with understandings of the region. She has exhibited widely, participating in biennales in Russia, Sharjah (UAE); solo exhibitions in the US and India, and prestigious group shows including ‘Unveiled, New Art From the Middle East’ at the Saatchi Gallery, London, and the touring Word Into Art exhibition at The British Museum and DIFC, Dubai."
Shadia Alem,"Shadia Alem has a following of admirers among the creative djinns of both the desert of Wadi Abkat and those of the Île de la Cité, where the bells of the Notre Dame at first 'confused' her to recite muslim prayers. If ever there is need to imagine a hunchback on the minarets of the Grand Mosque in Makkah many djinns will no doubt summon Shadia and her sister Raja to draw and write his grotesque lines with a single pencil to please both ears and eyes. The artist and her novel writing sister were born in Makkah and later lived in Taif where Shadia as a child is said to have drawn on the doors. By the time she lived in Paris Alem had managed to move up to painting landscapes on the tail fin of some British Airways aircraft."

Shafic Abboud,"Born in 1926 in Lebanon, Shafic Abboud is one of the foremost Arab artists of the 20th century. His paintings are a manifesto for freedom, colour, light and joy, as well as being a permanent bridge between the art scenes of France and Lebanon and that of Europe and the Middle East. Both Lebanese and Parisian, he was very attached to Lebanon, to its landscapes, its light and his own childhood memories. He was from a Lebanese Arab Modern culture. The stories of his grandmother, who was the village’s story-teller, left an indelible mark on him, at a very early age. He was familiar with the paintings of the travelling story-tellers. The artist’s eye was also strongly influenced by Byzantine icons and traditions from his church. The writings, debates, ideals, hopes and battles characterising the Arab Nahda, a modernist and anti-clerical Renaissance which was initially driven by Arab and Lebanese writers, were to later have a significant impact on Abboud’s intellectual education."

Shahrzad Changalvaee,"Shahrzad Changalvaee (born 1983, Iran) received a BA in Graphic Design from the Faculty of Fine Arts at Tehran University.  She uses typography as her medium to explore socio-political themes heavily influenced by her Persian heritage. Her explicative use of the Farsi language and its poetry creates graphic and dynamic imagery, captivating regardless of one’s knowledge of the language or culture. In What Lies Beneath | Second Edition, the artist presents a series of black and white photographs entitled ‘Mountains of Alas and Regret’ and a video work. The mountainscapes, playing with Farsi words by creating landscapes from them, redefine expressions of emotion, literally and metaphorically shrouding them to create an overwhelming sense of nostalgia. Chavangalaee explores the sensation of the sublime, the pleasant pain that feats of nature arouse. She evokes the countless ‘mountains’ that we feel defeated by, or disappointed by if we eventually reach their summit."

Shalima Sharbatli,"Shalima Sharbatli. So we read on the internet: in Jeddah the apples from France and the oranges from Egypt come in Sharbatli boxes and have Sharbatli stickers on them. It is no surprise then that Shalima Sharbatli informs people that she lives with art 24 hours a day. 'An instinctive Saudi painter,' she herself was branded by Arab News and having to juggle at a young age with a touch of paradise perhaps educated her with knowledge that needs discovery. No images of her artwork travel on the internet, but for the picture in Arab News of herself as an artist, revealing a pair of trousers usually reserved for the atelier, and in front of one of her large outside works in Jeddah. The latest news on her is that she is planning a joint exibition in Paris with two artists from France and Spain. Mitterand Jr. will open the show. It is indeed about finding - not building - bridges, but art is not an international language, as Shalima is quoted to have said in wonder of people who 'imprison' themselves in local subjects. Art needs a viewpoint. The very best artists have eyes at the back of their heads, instinctively. As she is reported to have said that the music made her proud, a closer look at Sharbatli's work will surely reveal some lines of the national anthem of Saudi Arabia. Perhaps the daring scale of her work is such a line and those visiting the government guesthouse in Jeddah, should look out for a 17 meter long wall painting and be the judge of it. The limited glimpse of her work in the Arab News photo reminds me of a Dutch woman of noble birth, Jacoba van Heemskerk, who's more abstract paintings were influenced by Cubism and German expressionism, and who started very much by painting with the brain and struggled to jump out. But that is not Shabatli. It looks like the paint jumped on her first."

Sirine Fattouh,"Sirine Fattouh puts into perspective the profound effects left by the war on Lebanon, her country of birth. She fled the combat with her entire family in 1989. Her work questions the way in which her memories have formed through the connections that she has renewed with her country since her exile. It also examines the collective memory of the Lebanese who have remained there, which plays a determining role in the make-up of their current identity. Bearing this in mind, she elects a stripped-down art form, which approaches the style of a documentary, and almost resembles archive material in its elimination of any fictional or aesthetic element in order to force the viewer to face up to the reality which confronts them. Sirine Fattouh means however to imprint a political dimension into her work: for example, in Perdu/Gagné, she gives a voice to the Lebanese women “who have rarely if ever had the chance to utter or express their own opinion.”"

Susan Hefuna,"Susan Hefuna’s practice incorporates drawing, sculpture, video and photography as well as ambitious participatory installations and workshops. At the core of this is her fascination with the networks and structures of connection that inhabit public spaces and become the framework for peoples’ interactions with each other as well as how these networks become visible through – amongst other things – cultural customs, architectural models and city planning. Structures and networks are not just concepts that Hefuna explores as subject matter but are also deployed in a more literal sense as mechanisms within her creative process. Within her recent drawings, inspired by these networks, Hefuna creates grids of connected dots with ink and pencil on multiple layers of tracing paper. These lattices are not created through strict predetermined systems but, rather, are intuitively composed and open to change and subversion. The outcomes evoke embroidery and tapestry, but also molecular structures, maps, cityscapes, or, as with much of her work, the intricacies of the traditional wooden mashrabiya screens of Cairo."

Tagreed Al-Bagshi,"Tagreed Al-Bagshi (1975) from Ahsa holds a BA in science and education and is a supervisor in the education of girls. She knows how to handle paint and learned to do so in painting classes given in Damman, Qatif and Syria. As a painter she has steadily been building a body of work, that shows she got to know the classics of modern art, which fit very well Saudi concepts that there is not much gain in trying to depict nature-true with paint. It is the modern abstaction which accepts gracefully our own failure at creation and makes the best of it. So at least could be a vision of art. A very frank Al-Bagshi shares with us however her first efforts of 2001 in her on-line gallery, which indicate she moved from a romantic sea shore vision to the inner thoughts of humans, often ruled by the moon; in form not unlike those caught in stone by Modigliani. It is in 2007 that suddenly again the sun appears and her paintings flow with colour. Then too, all figurative efforts sometimes dissolve as they did in two painted boards. It looks like the artist can now handle with wise ease anything that may sweep ashore in the Persian Gulf."

Talal Al-Zeid,"Talal Al-Zeid (1981) has a website which repeats three times an opening statement: that we should never judge a painting by its colour. Yes, that we should never judge a painting by its colour. And readers who agree with Talal should never judge a painting by its colour. As long as they remember that when the sky is blue it might not rain."

Tarek Al Ghoussein,"Palestinian photographer Tarek Al Ghoussein has spent the past 10 years considering how performance, interventions and photographic methods can be used to explore what it means to be situated within a landscape."
Tarek Al-Ghoussein,"Born in Kuwait in 1962, Tarek Al-Ghoussein’s position as a Palestinian Kuwaiti shapes the dominant themes of identity, displacement, and structural and political control prominent in much of his work. Al-Ghoussein received his Bachelor’s degree in photography from New York University and his Master’s degree in Fine Arts from the University of New Mexico. He has taught at the American University of Sharjah and is currently a professor at New York University in Abu Dhabi. His first exhibition with Taymour Grahne Gallery opened in September 2014. His work, photographs often featuring the figure of the artist silhouetted against barren urban and desert landscapes of the region, serves as a partial allegory for the obstacles and forms of control facing Palestinians both within and exiled from the Palestinian territories, as well as troubling Western representations of Arabs as terrorists. Other series use the desert as a stage for investigating the artist’s relationship to land and place, in the midst of the rapid urban transformation witnessed in the UAE, where the artist lives. In the words of Sabine Vogel, his work goes beyond the specific, and “transforms direct political references into the existentially universal.” (Sabine Vogel, Artforum, 4.29.10)Tarek's works are in the collections of several international museums and institutions, including the British Museum, London; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; Victoria and Albert Museum, London; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Mori Art Museum, Tokyo; the Sharjah Art Foundation, Sharjah, UAE; Mathaf Museum, Qatar; and the Barjeel Art Foundation, Sharjah, among others. His work has been shown internationally at the Sharjah Art Museum, Sharjah; the 53rd Venice Biennale, Venice; the 6th Sharjah Biennial, Sharjah; the Royal Photography Museum, Copenhagen; Aperture Gallery, New York."
Tarek Al-Ghoussein,"Tarek Al-Ghoussein was born in Kuwait in 1962. He received his BFA (Photography) from New York University in 1985 and his MA (Photography) from the University of New Mexico in 1989. As a Kuwaiti of Palestinian origin, much of Tarek’s work deals with how his identity is shaped in a context of inaccessibility and loss. His work explores the boundaries between landscape photography, self-portraiture and performance art."

Taysir Batniji,"Trained as a painter, but also a creator of installations and performances, since the 1990s Taysir Batniji has worked mainly with video and photography, two “light” mediums that fit with a career which has involved much travelling to and from between Palestine and Europe. He documents Palestinian reality in a physically vivid, anti-spectacular way by focusing on displacement, intermediate states, and the inhibition of movement. These objective issues which are part and parcel of the social, political and cultural context in Palestine also reflect the position of the artist as a witness and contributor to the life of his country, but also the Western art scene."

Walid Raad,"Born in 1967 in Chbanieh in the Lebanon, Walid Raad is an artist whose work reflects the troubled history of his country of origin, which he has witnessed since childhood. By collecting, modifying and creating photographs, texts and videos, he plays on the idea of the document as it relates to the civil war and the troubles between communities which have shaken this territory. The artist infuses his depictions with a cloudiness intended to throw doubt on the notion of documentation itself, and posing a profound question about how History is constructed. His working method involves artistic processes such as montage, hijacking and displacement which he uses to create his poetic, semantic distortions against the backgrounds he manipulates. Since 1999, this work on archives and memory through images has evolved around the Atlas Group, a fictitious organisation which produces, conserves and studies documents about the contemporary history of Lebanon, initiated and activated by Walid Raad. The artist is also a member of the AIF (Arab Image Foundation), an institution based in Beirut since 1997, responsible for collecting and promoting a visual heritage of the Middle East, North Africa and the Arab Diaspora.

Walid Sadek,"The early work of artist and writer Walid Sadek investigated the violent legacies of the Lebanese civil war (1975-1990) as partially and inadequately seen and experienced by a young Christian-born Lebanese. He later began to posit, mostly in theoretical texts, ways of understanding the complexity of lingering civil strife in times of relative social and economical stability. His recent written work, in art and in writing, endeavours to structure a theory for approaching the ambivalence of living through a protracted civil-war."

Youssef Nabil,"Brought up on the great era of Egyptian cinema Youssef Nabil retains a feeling of nostalgia for the glamorous aestheticism of the ‘40s and ‘50s. Born in Egypt in 1972, he grew up in the streets of Cairo where hand-painted cinema posters gave the walls a timeless elegance, whilst classics from a past era shown on television were to inspire his first love of the big screen."
Youssef Nabil,"Born in Egypt in 1972 and based in New York, Youssef Nabil grew up in a Cairo drenched in the golden age cinema of Hollywood on the Nile: a black and white film world in which he nostalgically recalls the glamour, the ease, the elegance and the melodrama.   His photos evoke the deliciously outmoded feel of the photo-novels that accompanied cinema at the time and highlight in each portrait the extraordinary character of his models, distinguished artists, actors, singers and friends."

Ziad Antar,"His videos undeniably testify to a world in conflict, but using a rather playful and light tone, Ziad Antar’s work immediately seduces.Focusing on a precise idea, Ziad Antar’s videos express life problems (sometimes linked to war) with a short shot and with simple means. It is with disconcerting ease and efficiency that Ziad Antar confronts the viewer with burning questions, without expressing any position and without empathy."
Ziad Antar,Lebanese photographer Ziad Antar uses photography and video in work where the artist's quiet and reflective stance reveals the social and political structures that influence daily life.
